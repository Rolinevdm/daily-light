**Morning**

**Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.**
 
God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. -- It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell. -- Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
 
Thou anointest my head with oil. -- The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
 
The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.
 
The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
