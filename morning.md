**Morning**

**The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them to search out a resting place for them.**
 
My times are in thy hand. -- He shall choose our inheritance for us. -- Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness; ... make thy way straight before my face.
 
Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shalt bring it to pass. -- In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. -- Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. -- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. -- Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
