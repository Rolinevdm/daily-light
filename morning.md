**Morning**

**Never man spake like this man.**
 
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. -- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. -- His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.
 
All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. -- He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. -- The sword of the Spirit ... is the word of God. -- The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoâ€‘edged sword. -- The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.
