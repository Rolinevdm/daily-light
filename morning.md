**Morning**

**Let your speech be always with grace.**
 
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. -- Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. -- A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. -- By thy words thou shalt be justified. -- The tongue of the wise is health.
 
They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.
 
If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. -- Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and know-ledge, and in all diligence, ... see that ye abound in this grace also.
