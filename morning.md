**Morning**

**Awake to righteousness, and sin not.**
 
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
 
It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. -- Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed: and make you a new heart and a new spirit. -- Lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. -- Little children, abide in him that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.
