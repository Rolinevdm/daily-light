**Morning**

**Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.**
 
Jehovah Nissi (The Lord my banner). -- When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
 
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. -- The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- The captain of our salvation.
 
My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. -- Valiant for the truth. -- Fight the Lord's battles. -- Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: fear ye not. -- Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. -- Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
