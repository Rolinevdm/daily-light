**Morning**

**I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eves: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.**
 
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. -- Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
 
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. -- I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
