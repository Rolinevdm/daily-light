**Morning**

**I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.**
 
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. -- We are all as an unclean thing. -- I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
 
As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. -- Ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. -- Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but ... the righteousness which is of God by faith.
 
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him. -- The fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.
