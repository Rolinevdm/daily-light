**Morning**

**I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.**
 
A new heart ... will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you. -- Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
 
That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
 
I ... beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, ... endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.  

**Jer 32:39; Ezek 36:26; Psa 25:8-10; John 17:21; Eph 4:1-6**
