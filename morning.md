**Morning**

**Abide in me, and I in you.**
 
I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. -- If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard.
 
Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. -- He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
