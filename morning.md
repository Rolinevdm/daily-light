**Morning**

**Understanding what the will of the Lord is.**
 
This is the will of God, even your sanctification. -- Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. -- This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. -- We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
 
We ... do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. -- The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, ... give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe.
