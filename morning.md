**Morning**

**When Chrlst, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.**
 
I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. -- God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. -- When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
 
If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
