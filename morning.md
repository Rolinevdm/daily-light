**Morning**

**Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth.**
 
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. -- I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. -- My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
 
I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. -- As a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee. -- Now no chastening for the present, seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.
 
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
