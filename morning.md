**Morning**

**Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.**
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. -- Whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. -- Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? -- The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
 
Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. -- We desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and perseverence inherit the promises. -- So run, that ye may obtain.
