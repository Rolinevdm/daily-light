**Morning**

**I delight in the law of God after the inward man.**
 
O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. -- Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart. -- I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. -- I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
 
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. -- My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
 
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyes. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. -- Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.
