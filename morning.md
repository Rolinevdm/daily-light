**Morning**

**I am the Lord your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them.**
 
As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of con-versation. -- He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. -- Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. -- Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God. -- Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes.
 
Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- The God of peace, ... make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ.
