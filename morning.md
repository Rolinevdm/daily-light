**Morning**

**Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.**
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
 
Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. -- Death and life are in the power of the tongue. --The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slide. -- Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
 
We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. -- I believed, therefore have I spoken.
 
Whosoever ... shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. -- With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
