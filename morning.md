**Morning**

**The fruit of the Spirit is joy.**
 
Joy in the Holy Ghost. -- Unspeakable and full of glory. Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; ... exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. -- We glory in tribulations.
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; ... for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame. -- These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be fuIl. -- As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. -- The joy of the Lord is your strength. In thy presence is fulness of joy: at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. -- For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
