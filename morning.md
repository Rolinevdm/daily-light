**Morning**

**As thy days, so shall thy strength be.**
 
When they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. -- Take no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
 
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in re-proaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
