**Morning**

**Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.**
 
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
 
His Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
 
I and my Father are one. The Father is in me, and I in him. -- My Father, and your Father; and ... my God, and your God. -- I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.
 
The Church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
 
Having ... these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
