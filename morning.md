**Morning**

**As the body is one, and hath many members, ... so also is Christ.**
 
He is the head of the body, the church. -- The head over things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. -- We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
 
A body hast thou prepared me. -- Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
 
Thine they were, and thou gavest them me. -- He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.
 
Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth ... maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
