**Morning**

**He preserveth the way of his saints.**
 
The Lord your God ... went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. -- As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him. -- The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. -- Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. -- For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. -- We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. -- With us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles.
 
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy.
