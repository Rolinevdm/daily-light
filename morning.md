**Morning**

**We know that we have passed from death unto life.**
 
He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. -- He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 
He which stablisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. -- Hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. -- We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
 
You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sin. -- Quickened ... together with Christ. -- Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom his dear Son.
