**Morning**

**Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.**
 
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. -- There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth. -- There is no spot in thee.
 
Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy. -- As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. -- Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. -- He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should he holy and without blame before him in love.
