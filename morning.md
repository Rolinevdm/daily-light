**Morning**

**A bruised reed shall he not break.**
 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. -- He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. -- Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
 
I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. -- Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. -- Behold, your God ... will come and save you.
