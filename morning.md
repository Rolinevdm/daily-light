**Morning**

**Pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.**
 
The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. -- Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. -- When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any.
 
Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. -- Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.
 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. -- My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins.
