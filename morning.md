**Morning**

**God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.**
 
It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell; and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself. -- Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil. -- Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
 
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?
 
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace. -- Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
