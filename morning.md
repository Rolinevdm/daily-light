**Morning**

**The only wise God our Saviour.**
 
Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. -- Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
 
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory. -- The mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known, by the church, the manifold wisdom of God.
 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. -- The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
