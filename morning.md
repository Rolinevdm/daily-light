**Morning**

**The kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods ... to every man according to his several ability.**
 
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?
 
All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. -- As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. -- It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. --Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have commited much, of him they will ask the more.
 
Who is sufficient for these things? -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.  

**Matt 23:14,13; Rom 6:16; 1 Cor 12:11,7; 1 Pet 4:10; 1 Cor 4:2; Luke 12:48; 2 Cor 2:16; Phl 4:13**
