**Morning**

**The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.**
 
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. -- The blood of the Lamb. -- The precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. -- Without shedding of blood is no remission. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
 
By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. -- Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.
 
Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
