**Morning**

**Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.**
 
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. -- The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable. -- Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
 
What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. -- Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
