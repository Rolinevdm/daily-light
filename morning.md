**Morning**

**Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.**
 
By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. -- When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light. -- Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
 
I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. -- We have also a sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. -- Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. -- They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
