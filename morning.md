**Morning**

**The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.**
 
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.
 
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. -- For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
