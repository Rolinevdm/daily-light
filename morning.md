**Morning**

**Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.**
 
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. -- I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
 
Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? -- Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -- In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.
 
The effect of righteousness [shall be] quietness and assurance for ever. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.
