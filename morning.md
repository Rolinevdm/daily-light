**Morning**

**The blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.**
 
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. -- The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. -- It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
 
Abel, ... brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof ... The Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. -- Christ ... hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.
 
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- Having ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
