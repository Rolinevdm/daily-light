**Morning**

**Thy name is as ointment poured forth.**
 
Christ ... hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. -- Unto you therefore which believe he is precious. -- God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. -- In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
 
If ye love me, keep my commandments. -- The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. -- The house was filled with the odour of the ointment. -- They took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
 
O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. -- Emmanuel ... God with us. -- His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. -- The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
