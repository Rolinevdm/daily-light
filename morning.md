**Morning**

**Thou God seest me.**
 
O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether ... Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
 
The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. -- The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. -- God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. -- The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.
 
Jesus ... knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man. -- Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.
