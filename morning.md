**Morning**

**The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light.**
 
The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spint of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. -- Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
 
I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image ... even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
 
The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: ... that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.  

**Luke 11:34; 1 Cor 2:14; Psa 119:18; John 8:12; 2 Cor 3:18; 2 Cor 4:6; Eph 1:17,18**
