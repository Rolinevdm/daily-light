**Morning**

**My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.**
 
Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all ... things shall be added unto you. -- He that spared not his Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things? -- All things are yours: whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come: all are yours: and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. -- The Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly. -- The living God, ... giveth us richly all things to enjoy. -- God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.
