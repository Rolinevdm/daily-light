**Morning**

**Thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.**
 
I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
 
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us. Help us, O God of our salvaton, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. -- Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. -- We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
 
If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
