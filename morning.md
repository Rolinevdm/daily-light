**Morning**

**A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.**
 
Him that judgeth righteously. -- We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. -- Every one of us shall give account of himself to God. -- The soul that sinneth it shall die.
 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd. -- The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other. -- Mercy rejoiceth against judgment. -- The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
 
A just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. -- Just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- Justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
