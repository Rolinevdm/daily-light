**Morning**

**Fear not; I am the first and the last.**
 
Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, but ye are come unto mount Sion, ... to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant. -- Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. -- We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
 
Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, aud his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. -- The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? -- Who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?
