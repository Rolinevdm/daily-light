**Morning**

**The goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.**
 
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. -- In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. -- Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. -- Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?
 
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- He shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. -- The Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
