**Morning**

**I know that my Redeemer liveth.**
 
If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. -- This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
 
Because I live, ye shall live also. -- If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
 
The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. -- We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. -- Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
