**Morning**

**The Lord was my stay.**
 
Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. -- The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. -- Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
 
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. -- So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
 
By the grace of God I am what I am.
