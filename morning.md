**Morning**

**I have seen his ways, and will heal him.**
 
I am the LORD that healeth thee.
 
O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. -- Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. -- All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- He is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him: and with his stripes we are healed. -- He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted. -- Thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
