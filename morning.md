**Morning**

**The living God giveth us richly all things to enjoy.**
 
Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; ... then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God: ... for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.
 
Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. -- They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them -- There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.  

**1 Tim 6:17; Deut 8:11,12,14,18; Psa 127:1,2; Psa 44:3; Psa 4:6**
