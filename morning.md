**Morning**

**The fellowship of His sufferings.**
 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.
 
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. -- In the world ye shall have tribulation. -- Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
 
I looked for some to take pity, but there was none. -- At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.
 
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
 
Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
