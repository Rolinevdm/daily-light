**Morning**

**I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.**
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost.
 
The Lord taketh pleasure in his people. -- My delights were with the sons of men. -- His great love wherewith he loved us. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
 
Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in you body, and in your spirit, which are God's. -- Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
