**Morning**

**A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest.**
 
Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same. -- The man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts. -- I and my Father are one.
 
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. -- There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain. -- The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
 
When my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. -- Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble. -- Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
