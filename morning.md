**Morning**

**It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.**
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. -- I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. -- We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering an offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. -- Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
 
I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
