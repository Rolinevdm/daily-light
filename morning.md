**Morning**

**Patient in tribulation.**
 
It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good. -- Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. -- The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. -- What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?
 
Jesus wept. -- A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.
 
Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. -- In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
