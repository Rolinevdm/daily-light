**Morning**

**Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps.**
 
Even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. -- Whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. Jesus of Nazareth ... went about doing good. -- Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. The meekness and gentleness of Christ. -- In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
 
Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do. -- Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
 
He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. -- Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
