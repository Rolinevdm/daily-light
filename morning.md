**Morning**

**If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.**
 
I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.
 
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. -- I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. -- Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. -- God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- That he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 
Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. -- They shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
 
This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood.
