**Morning**

**If ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you;**
 
those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
 
Fight the good fight of faith. -- The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, ... and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.
 
Brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
 
The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. -- I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  

**Num 33:55; 1 Tim 6:12; 2 Cor 10:4,5; Rom 8:12,13; Gal 5:17; Rom 7:23; Rom 8:37**
