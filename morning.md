**Morning**

**It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.**
 
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? -- I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
 
Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. -- Wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. -- Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
 
Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: ... in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
