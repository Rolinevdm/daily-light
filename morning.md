**Morning**

**Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.**
 
The man Christ Jesus. -- Made in the likeness of men ... found in fashion as a man. -- Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death.
 
I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore. -- Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. -- What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before? -- He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places. -- In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
 
Though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God.
