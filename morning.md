**Morning**

**Leaning on Jesus' bosom.**
 
As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you. -- They brought young children to him, that he should touch them. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. -- Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. -- A high Priest ... touched with the feeling of our infirmities. -- In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.
 
I will not leave you comfortless: (marg. orphans) I will come to you. -- Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
 
The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
