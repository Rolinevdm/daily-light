**Morning**

**There shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand.**
 
Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing. -- Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. -- Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
 
Beloved, now are we the sons of God ... And it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. -- The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
