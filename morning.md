**Morning**

**The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his will.**
 
Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
 
By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast. -- Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.
 
Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- Be ye trans-formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.
