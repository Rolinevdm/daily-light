**Morning**

**Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.**
 
Go ye ... into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. -- Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. -- The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. -- God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, ... in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
 
Every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
 
Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, ... Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
