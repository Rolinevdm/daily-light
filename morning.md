**Morning**

**Make his praise glorious.**
 
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. -- I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth. -- By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
 
I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. -- Who is like unto thee, O LORD, ... glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. -- They sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.
