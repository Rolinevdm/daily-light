**Morning**

**Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.**
 
O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. -- No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
 
I would have you without carefulness. -- Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
 
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. -- Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? -- Have faith in God.
