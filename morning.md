**Morning**

**The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.**
 
The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. -- Thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
 
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. -- I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
 
Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept.
 
The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
