**Morning**

**He that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.**
 
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy. -- Hallowed be thy name.
 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people.
 
Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. -- I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
 
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, ... be glory.
