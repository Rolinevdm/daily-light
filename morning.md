**Morning**

**Thou art my portion, O Lord.**
 
All things are yours; ... and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ ... gave himself for us. -- God gave him to be the head over all things to the church. -- Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
 
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. -- I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. -- O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord. The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintamest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
