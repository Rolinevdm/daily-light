**Morning**

**As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.**
 
Our Saviour Jesus Christ, ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. -- I am the resurrection, and the life. -- Because I live, ye shall live also. -- We are made partakers of Christ. -- Partakers of the Holy Ghost. -- Partakers of the divine nature. -- The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. -- Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. -- Who liveth for ever and ever. -- The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality. -- Unto the King eternal, immortal, ... be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
