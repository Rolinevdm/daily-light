**Morning**

**Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands.**
 
Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon us.
 
Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. -- Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established.
 
Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
