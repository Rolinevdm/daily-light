**Morning**

**Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.**
 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. -- LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear. -- For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
 
Jacob said unto his household, ... Let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. -- Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
 
I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I on the name of the LORD.
