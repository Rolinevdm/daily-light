**Morning**

**Think upon me, my God, for good.**
 
Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness. -- I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. -- I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you. -- For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
 
As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. -- I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number. -- Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered.
