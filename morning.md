**Morning**

**Thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name.**
 
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
 
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken ... but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, ... for the Lord delighteth in thee. And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. -- He hath sent me ... to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
 
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 
I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness and in mercies.
 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  

**Isa 54:5; Eph 5:32; Isa 62:4,5; Isa 61:1â€‘3; Isa 61:10; Hos 2:19; Rom 8:35**
