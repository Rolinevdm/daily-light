**Morning**

**Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.**
 
Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. -- Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground ... I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God ot Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. -- To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. -- I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.
 
As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conver-sation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. -- Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own. -- Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. -- Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
