**Morning**

**Let us labour to enter into that rest.**
 
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction: ... strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. -- The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. -- Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you. -- Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: ... for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. -- So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
 
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. -- The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
