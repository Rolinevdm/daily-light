**Morning**

**Oh that thou wouldest keep me from evil.**
 
Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. -- The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
 
Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
 
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. -- I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. -- He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
 
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. -- The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.
