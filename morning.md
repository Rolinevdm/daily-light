**Morning**

**His name shall be called Wonderful.**
 
The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. -- Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
 
They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. -- JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
 
All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. -- God ... hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. -- Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet. -- He had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself ... KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
 
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out. -- What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
