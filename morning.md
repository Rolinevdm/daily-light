**Morning**

**If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only.**
 
Little children, keep yourselves from idols. -- Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. -- Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.
 
Thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. -- Serve him with a perfect heart with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.
 
Behold, thou desireth truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. -- Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. -- Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
