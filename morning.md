**Morning**

**The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.**
 
Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. -- God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. -- I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. -- Who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! -- As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. For who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?If any man love God, the same is known of him. -- The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. -- The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. -- Thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
