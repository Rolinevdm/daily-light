**Morning**

**Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.**
 
It shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. -- I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. -- I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. -- Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
