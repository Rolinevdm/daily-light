**Morning**

**We which have believed do enter into rest.**
 
They weary themselves to commit iniquity. -- I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. -- Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
 
He that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works. -- Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. -- This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing.
