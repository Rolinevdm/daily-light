**Morning**

**Thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.**
 
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. -- In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. -- Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the LORD thy maker?
 
I am with thee to deliver thee. -- Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
 
I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. -- Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.
