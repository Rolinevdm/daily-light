**Morning**

**He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.**
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity. -- Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you ... depart from me, ye that work iniquity. -- The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
 
Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. -- Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm. -- The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.
 
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
