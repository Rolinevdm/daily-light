**Morning**

**The God of all grace.**
 
I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. -- He is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. -- Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. -- Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
 
By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. -- Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. -- As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. -- He giveth more grace.
 
Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.
