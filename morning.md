**Morning**

**He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.**
 
Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods and have need of nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore and repent.
 
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. -- When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. -- I am the Lord thy God ... open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.
 
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. -- I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
