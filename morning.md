**Morning**

**By faith Abraham, ... called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed.**
 
He shall choose our inheritance for us. -- He led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
 
I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go. -- Who teacheth like Him?
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. -- Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul. -- Arise ye and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.
