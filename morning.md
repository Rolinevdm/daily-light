**Morning**

**Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.**
 
Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
 
O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see we beseech thee, we are all thy people. -- Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. -- It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
 
Affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
