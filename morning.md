**Morning**

**Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.**
 
How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? -- I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. -- He died for all, that they which live should not live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. -- If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
 
We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. -- As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. -- Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. -- Because I live, ye shall live also.
 
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and wilt give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
