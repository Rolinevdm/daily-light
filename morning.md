**Morning**

**In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.**
 
He was numbered with the transgressors. -- Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. -- By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
 
This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- While we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
 
Forasmuch ... as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
