**Morning**

**Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins**
 
Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins. -- That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness. -- He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.
 
He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, ... that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations. -- He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
 
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, ... to give repentance. -- Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. -- Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
