**Morning**

**He shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.**
 
Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.
 
He hath made us accepted in the Beloved. As lively stones, ... built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. -- I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
 
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.  

**Lev 1:4; 1 Pet 1:18,19; 1 Pet 2:24; Eph 1:6; 1 Pet 2:5; Rom 12:1; Jude 24,25**
