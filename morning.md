**Morning**

**They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord harkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.**
 
It came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. -- Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst ot them. -- My fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and ad-onishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. -- Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
 
Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. -- Behold, it is written before me.  

**Mal 3:16; Luke 24:15; Matt 18:20; Phl 4:3; Col 3:16; Heb 3:13; Matt 12:36,37; Isa 65:6**
