**Morning**

**It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.**
 
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. -- God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. -- Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. -- By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.
 
Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. -- And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power. -- Of his fulness have all we received.
