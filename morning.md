**Morning**

**His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.**
 
Underneath are the everlasting arms. -- When [Peter] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? -- The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
 
The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. -- Casting all your care upon Him, for he careth tor you. -- He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.
 
They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all.
