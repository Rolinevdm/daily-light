**Morning**

**Their Redeemer is strong.**
 
I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins. -- I have laid help upon one that is mighty. -- The Lord ... thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. -- Mighty to save. -- Able to keep you from falling. -- Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
 
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- He is able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.
 
Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?
 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? ... I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
