**Morning**

**God is my defence.**
 
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; the God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour. -- The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
 
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. -- We may boldly say, The LORD is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
 
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. -- Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
 
For thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
