**Morning**

**Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.**
 
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
 
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. -- A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
 
He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Christ ... loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.
