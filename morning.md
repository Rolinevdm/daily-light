**Morning**

**As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.**
 
Not every one that saith, ... Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. -- Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.
 
By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.  

**Jas 2:26; Matt 7:21; Heb 12:14; 2 Pet 1:5-10; Eph 2:8,9**
