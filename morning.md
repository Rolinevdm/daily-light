**Morning**

**Be strong, and work; for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.**
 
I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. -- The joy of the Lord is your strength.
 
Thus said the Lord of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets. -- Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. -- The Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
