**Morning**

**Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.**
 
Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. -- Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
 
Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry ... Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
 
What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
