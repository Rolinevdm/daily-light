**Morning**

**The ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.**
 
Unto you ... which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, ... a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence. -- The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
 
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. -- Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. -- The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. -- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. -- Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.
 
He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. -- Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life. -- My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
