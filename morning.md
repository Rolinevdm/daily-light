**Morning**

**The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.**
 
Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come. -- The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
 
The Comforter ... even the Spirit of truth. -- The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. -- The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
 
My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest. And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us?
