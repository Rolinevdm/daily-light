**Morning**

**He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied.**
 
Jesus ... said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. -- He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
 
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. -- To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which be purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
