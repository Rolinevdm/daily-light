**Morning**

**Him that was to come.**
 
Jesus ... made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, ... that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. -- One died for all. -- As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
 
The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spint. -- That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. -- God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. -- God ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- Thou hast given him power over all flesh.
 
The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
