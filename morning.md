**Morning**

**The fruit ot the Spirit is goodness.**
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children. -- Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. -- Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
 
After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
