**Morning**

**One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.**
 
Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you. -- The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls. -- It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
 
Jesus said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. -- By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. -- Peace through the blood of his cross.
 
Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, ... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, ... manifest in these last times for you.
 
Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean: ... from all your idols, will I cleanse you. -- Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.
