He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. -- In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
 
Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. -- That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.
 
Jesus of Nazareth ... went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. -- As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
 
That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. -- Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
