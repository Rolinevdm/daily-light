**Morning**

**There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.**
 
For as much ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
 
We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- In Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace. -- By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. -- He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
