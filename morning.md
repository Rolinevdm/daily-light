**Morning**

**The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.**
 
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
 
Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly. -- That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. -- In all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. -- Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. And take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
