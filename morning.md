**Morning**

**Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.**
 
If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. -- Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. -- Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness.
 
Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. -- Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.
