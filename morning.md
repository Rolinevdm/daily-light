**Morning**

**Fear not; for I have redeemed thee.**
 
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. -- For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. -- With the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
 
Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause. -- My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
 
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
