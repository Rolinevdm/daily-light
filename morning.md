**Morning**

**I, even I, am he that comforteth you.**
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. -- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you. -- Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.
 
Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
 
Another Comforter ... even the Spirit of truth. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities.
 
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
