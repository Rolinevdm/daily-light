**Morning**

**Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide.**
 
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.
 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? -- The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
 
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. -- This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night. -- My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: when I remem-ber thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
