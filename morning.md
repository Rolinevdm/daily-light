**Morning**

**They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels.**
 
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am: that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
 
I will come again, and receive you unto myself. -- He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe ... in that day. -- We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. -- Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
