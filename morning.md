**Morning**

**The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.**
 
Your lamb shall be without blemish, ... and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it, ... and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. -- The blood of sprinkling. -- Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. -- Being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. -- According to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.
 
We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
