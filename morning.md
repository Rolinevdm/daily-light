**Morning**

**Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.**
 
Just Lot ... that righteous man. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. -- Remember Lot's wife.
 
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing. -- Be not ye ... partakers with them. For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.  

**Gen 13:10,11; 2 Pet 2:7,8; Gal 6:7; Luke 17:32; 2 Cor 6:14,17; Eph 5:7,8,10,11**
