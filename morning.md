**Morning**

**Whom having not seen, ye love.**
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. -- In whom ye trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. -- God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
 
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. -- Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
