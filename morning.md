**Morning**

**What profit is there of circumcision?**
 
Much every way. -- Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart. -- If ... their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember.
 
Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers. -- In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. -- You, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.
 
Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness.
