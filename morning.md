**As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.**
 
The fellowship of his sufferings. -- Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. -- Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
