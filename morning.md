**Morning**

**I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth.**
 
It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if l depart, I will send him unto you.
 
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. -- Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
