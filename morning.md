**Morning**

**Walk in love.**
 
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. -- Above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. -- Love covereth all sins.
 
When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. -- Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again. -- Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth. -- Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrar-wise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. -- If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. -- Be ye kind one to another, tenderâ€‘hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
 
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
