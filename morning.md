**Morning**

**Take thou also unto thee principal spices, and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment.**
 
Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. -- One Spirit. -- Diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
 
Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. -- God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. -- God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
 
Of his fulness have all we received. -- As the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. -- He which ... hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
