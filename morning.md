**Morning**

**The whole family in heaven and earth.**
 
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. -- Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. -- That in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.
 
He is not ashamed to call them brethren. -- Behold my mother and my brethren! Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. -- Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father.
 
I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: ... and white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. -- That they without us should not be made perfect.
