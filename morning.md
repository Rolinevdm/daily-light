**Morning**

**Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.**
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. -- After that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.
 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
