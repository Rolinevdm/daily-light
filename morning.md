**Morning**

**The Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.**
 
Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. -- Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. -- Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
 
Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall he added unto you.
 
As long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper. -- Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
 
Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side?
