**Morning**

**Our God hath not forsaken us.**
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. -- If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
 
The LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
 
The LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. -- Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. -- Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God.
 
Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.
