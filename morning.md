**Morning**

**What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.**
 
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light.
 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn turn to the left. -- I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
 
O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
