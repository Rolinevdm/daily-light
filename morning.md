**Morning**

**Ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God giveth you.**
 
This is not your rest. -- There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. -- Within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.
 
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. -- With Christ; which is far better.
 
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away. -- There the wicked cease from troubling: and there the weary be at rest.
 
Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
