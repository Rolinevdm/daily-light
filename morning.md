**Morning**

**We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.**
 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- Ye thought evil against me: but God meant it unto good.
 
All things are yours; whether ... the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- All things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
 
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.  

**Rom 8:28; Psa 76:10; Gen 50:20; 1 Cor 3:21-23; 2 Cor 4:15-17; Jas 1:2-4**
