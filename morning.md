**Morning**

**Thou art my hope in the day of evil.**
 
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. -- I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou has been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
 
In my prosperity I said, I wishall never be moved. Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. I cried to thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.
 
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord my Redeemer. -- Sorrow shall be turned into joy. -- Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
