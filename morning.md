**Morning**

**In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.**
 
My beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. -- He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. -- If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body. -- By thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. -- Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
 
Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but com-mitted himself to him that judgeth righteously. -- Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
 
In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
