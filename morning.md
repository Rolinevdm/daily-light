**Morning**

**Who can say, I have made my heart clean?**
 
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. -- They that are in the flesh cannot please God.
 
To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. -- We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags: and we all do fade as a leaf: and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
 
The scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. -- God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
