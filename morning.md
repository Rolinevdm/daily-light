**Morning**

**He will rest in his love.**
 
The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loved you. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- You ... hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.
 
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. -- God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
 
Look, at a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. -- His son ... who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.
