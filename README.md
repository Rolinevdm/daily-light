# Morning

**Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.**
 
Just Lot ... that righteous man. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. -- Remember Lot's wife.
 
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing. -- Be not ye ... partakers with them. For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.  

**Gen 13:10,11; 2 Pet 2:7,8; Gal 6:7; Luke 17:32; 2 Cor 6:14,17; Eph 5:7,8,10,11**

# Evening

**If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.**
 
He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
 
Stand ... having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. -- The Lord is with thee, ... Go in this thy might.  

**Josh 14:12; Heb 13:5,6; Psa 71:16; Isa 32:17; Eph 6:14,12,13; Judg 6:12,14**
