# Morning

**Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.**
 
The world passeth away, and the lust thereof. -- Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches. and knoweth not who shall gather them. -- What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
 
Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. -- I would have you without carefulness.
 
These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world. -- The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. -- The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.  

**John 14:27; 1 John 2:17; Psa 39:6; Rom 6:21; Luke 10:41,42; 1 Cor 7:32; John 1633; 2 Thes 3:16; Num 6:24â€‘26**

# Evening

**The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.**
 
The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. -- What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God? -- It is God which worketh in you.
 
We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
 
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  

**Rom 8:26; John 14:26; 1 Cor 6:19; Phl 2:13; Rom 8:26,27; Psa 103:14; Isa 42:3; Matt 26:41; Psa 23:1,2**
