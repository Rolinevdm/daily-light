## Morning

**Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.**
 
The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 
Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. -- If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. -- Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. -- Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  

**1 John 2:5; Heb 13:20,21; 1 John 2:3; John 14:23; 1 John 3:6,7; 1 John 4:17**

## Evening

**He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding.**
 
The Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering. -- The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us‑ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love. -- The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. -- This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.
 
Be ye angry, and sin not.  

**Prov 14:29; Exo 34:6; 2 Pet 3:9; Eph 5:1; Gal 5:22,23; 1 Pet 2:19‑21,23; Eph 4:26**
