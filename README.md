# Morning

**There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.**
 
For as much ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
 
We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- In Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace. -- By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. -- He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  

**1 Tim 2:5; Heb 2:14; Isa 45:22; 1 John 2:1; Eph 2:13,14; Heb 9:12,15; Heb 7:25**

# Evening

**O my God, my soul is cast down within me.**
 
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.
 
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. -- He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. -- Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.
 
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? -- Be not faithless, but believing. -- Lo, I am with you alway.  

**Psa 42:6; Isa 26:3,4; Psa 55:22; Psa 22:24; Jas 5:13; John 14:27; Matt 6:25,26; John 20:27; Matt 28:20**
