# Morning

**Faithful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.**
 
I beseech you, ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. -- As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. -- In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy.
 
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. -- I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  

**Col 1:10; Rom 12:1,2; Rom 6:19; Gal 6:15,16; John 15:8; John 15:16**

# Evening

**I sought him, but I found him not.**
 
Return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously.
 
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
 
Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. -- It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. -- Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
 
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.  

**Song 3:1; Hos 14:1,2; Jas 1:13-17; Psa 27:14; Lam 3:26; Luke 18:7; Psa 62:1,5**
