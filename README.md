# Morning

**Their Redeemer is strong.**
 
I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins. -- I have laid help upon one that is mighty. -- The Lord ... thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. -- Mighty to save. -- Able to keep you from falling. -- Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
 
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- He is able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.
 
Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?
 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? ... I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

**Jer 50:34; Amos 5:12; Psa 89:19; Isa 49:26; Isa 63:1; Jude 24; Rom 5:20; John 3:18; Heb 7:25; Isa 50:2; Rom 8:35,38,39**

# Evening

**Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.**
 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. -- Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
 
He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. -- Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
 
Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
 
I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.  

**Jer 45:5; Matt 11:29; Phl 2:5‑8; Matt 10:38; 1 Pet 2:21; 1 Tim 6:6‑8; Phl 4:11**
