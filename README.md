# Morning

**I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.**
 
We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- God ... hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. -- Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
 
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  

**Jer 31:3; 2 Thes 2:13,14; 2 Tim 1:9; Psa 139:16; John 3:16; 1 John 4:10**

# Evening

**I have made, and I will bear.**
 
Thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. -- Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you.
 
As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the LORD alone did lead him. -- He bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever. -- For I am persuaded, that neither ... height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
 
Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  

**Isa 46:4; Isa 43:1,2; Isa 46:4; Deut 32:11,12; Isa 63:9; Heb 13:8; Rom 8:38,39; Isa 49:15**
