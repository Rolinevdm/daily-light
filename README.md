# Morning

**God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.**
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
 
Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. -- The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.
 
Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.  

**Gen 41:52; 2 Cor 1:3‑5; 1 Pet 1:6,7; 2 Tim 4:17; 1 Pet 4:19**

# Evening

**There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.**
 
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; they ... rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
 
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ... Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened. -- Ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope ... But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  

**Heb 4:9; Job 3:17,18; Rev 14:13; John 11:11,13; 2 Cor 5:4; Rom 8:23‑25**
