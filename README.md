# Morning

**Rejoicing in hope.**
 
The hope which is laid up for you in heaven. -- If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. -- We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. -- Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me cannot be my disciple. -- No man should be moved by these afflictions, for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. -- The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. -- Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom though now ye see him not, yet believing. ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. -- By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  

**Rom 12:12; Col 1:5; 1 Cor 15:19; Acts 14:22; Luke 14:27; 1 Thes 3:3; Phl 4:4; Rom 15:13; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Pet 1:8; Rom 5:2**

# Evening

**I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me.**
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil. -- My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
 
How precious ... are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. -- LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. -- Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward.
 
Not many mighty, not many noble, are called. -- Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom? -- Having nothing, and yet possessing all things. -- The unsearchable riches of Christ.
