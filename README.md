# Morning

**The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name.**
 
If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. -- If ye ... being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? -- Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. -- Ye have not, because ye ask not.
 
When ... the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
 
They rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.  

**John 14:26; John 4:10; Luke 11:13; John 16:23,24; Jas 4:2; John 16:13,14; Isa 63:10**

# Evening

**What think ye of Christ?**
 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. -- He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
 
Unto you ... which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner. -- Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. -- Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee.  

**Matt 22:42; Psa 24:9,10; Rev 9:16; 1 Pet 2:7; 1 Cor 1:23,24; Phl 3:8; John 21:17**
