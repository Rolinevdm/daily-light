# Morning

**Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.**
 
Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. -- Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. -- The commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.
 
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.
 
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!  

**Psa 112:4; Isa 50:10; Psa 37:24; Prov 6:23; Mic 7:8,9; Matt 6:22,23**

# Evening

**He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lend those that are with young.**
 
I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: ... I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. -- We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.
 
They brought young children to him, and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.
 
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant. -- The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. -- Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
 
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. -- I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.  

**Isa 40:11; Matt 15:32; Heb 4:15; Mark 10:13,16; Psa 119:176; Luke 19:10; 1 Pet 2:25; Luke 12:32; Ezek 34:15**
