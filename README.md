# Morning

**The Lord will provide.**
 
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. -- There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
 
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God. -- Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from death.
 
My God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusteth in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth: and with my song will I praise him.  

**Gen 22:14; Gen 22:8; Isa 59:1; Rom 11:26; Psa 146:5; Psa 33:18,19; Phl 4:19; Heb 13:5,6; Psa 28:7**
