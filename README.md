# Morning

**Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.**
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. -- Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. -- In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. -- Your life is hid with Christ in God.
 
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting the Lord.
 
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.  

**Matt 24:6; Psa 46:1-3; Isa 26:20,21; Psa 57:1; Col 3:3; Psa 112:7; John 16:33**

# Evening

**They persecute him whom thou hast smitten.**
 
It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! -- Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain. -- They did spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? -- Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross. -- Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
 
Surely he hath borne our grief, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.  

**Psa 69:26; Luke 17:1; Acts 2:23; Matt 26:67,68; Matt 27:41,42; Acts 4:27,28; Isa 53:4**
