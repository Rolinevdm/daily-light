# Morning

**Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.**
 
Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
 
The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.  

**Matt 25:13; Luke 21:34‑36; 1 Thes 5:2‑6**

# Evening

**I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.**
 
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect. I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
 
Enoch walked with God and he was not; for God took him.
 
Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. These words spake Jesus, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.  

**Gen 17:1; Phl 3:12‑14; Gen 5:24; 2 Pet 3:18; 2 Cor 3:18; John 17:1,15,23**
