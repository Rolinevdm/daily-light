# Morning

**He is altogether lovely.**
 
My meditation of him shall be sweet. -- My beloved is ... the chiefest among ten thousand. -- A chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. -- Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips. -- God ... hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. -- It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.
 
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
 
I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.  

**Song 5:16; Psa 104:34; Song 5:10; 1 Pet 2:6; Psa 45:2; Phl 2:9; Col 1:19; 1 Pet 1:8; Phl 3:8,9**

# Evening

**David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.**
 
Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he de-lighted in me.
 
I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.  

**1 Sam 30:6; John 6:68; 2 Tim 1:12; Psa 18:6,18,19; Psa 34:1-4,8**
