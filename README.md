# Morning

**He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.**
 
The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. -- As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
 
After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. -- There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
 
The LORD our Righteousness.  

**2 Cor 5:21; Isa 53:6; 1 Pet 2:24; Rom 5:19; Tit 3:4-7; Rom 8:1; Jer 23:6**

# Evening

**I will be as the dew unto Israel.**
 
The meekness and gentleness of Christ.
 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
 
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he began to say unto thern, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.
 
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
 
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.  

**Hos 14:5; 2 Cor 10:1; Isa 42:3; Luke 4:18,19,21,22; Luke 22:61,62; Isa 40:11**
