# Morning

**Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.**
 
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
 
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. -- A new command-ment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
 
He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Christ ... loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.  

**John 13:1; John 17:9,10,15,16; John 15:9; John 15:13,14; John 13:34; Phl 1:6; Eph 5:25,26**

# Evening

**The deep things of God.**
 
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. -- It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.
 
We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
 
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.  

**1 Cor 2:10; John 15:15; Matt 13:11; 1 Cor 2:12; Eph 3:14-19**
