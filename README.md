# Morning

**Let your speech be always with grace.**
 
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. -- Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. -- A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. -- By thy words thou shalt be justified. -- The tongue of the wise is health.
 
They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.
 
If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth. -- Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and know-ledge, and in all diligence, ... see that ye abound in this grace also.  

**Col 4:6; Prov 25:11,12; Eph 4:29; Matt 12:35; Matt 12:37; Prov 12:18; Mal 3:16; Jer 15:19; 2 Cor 8:7**

# Evening

**Thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes.**
 
The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. -- Your Father which is in heaven: ... maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetâ€‘smelling savour. -- Be ye kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. -- The love of Christ constraineth us.
 
Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  

**Psa 26:3; Psa 145:8; Matt 5:45; Eph 5:1,2; Eph 4:32; 1 Pet 1:22; 2 Cor 5:14; Luke 6:35,36**
