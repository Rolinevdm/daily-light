# Morning

**Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.**
 
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. -- My brethren, ye ... are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. -- Being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ. -- The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. -- Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. -- If the Son ... shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.  

**Rom 6:14; Rom 6:15; Rom 7:4; 1 Cor 9:21; 1 Cor 15:56,57; Rom 8:2; John 8:34; John 8:36; Gal 5:1**

# Evening

**A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.**
 
No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
 
He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. -- Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. -- What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
 
Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: but speaking the truth in love, ... grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ.
 
Abide in me. -- Be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  

**Jas 1:8; Luke 9:62; Heb 11:6; Jas 1:6,7; Mark 11:24; Eph 4:14,15; John 15:4; 1 Cor 15:58**
