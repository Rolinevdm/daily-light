# Morning

**Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.**
 
The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. -- Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. -- Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life. -- The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
 
What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand.  

**Rev 3:2; 1 Pet 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8; Deut 4:9; Heb 10:38,39; Mark 13:37; Isa 41:10,13**

# Evening

**Is his mercy clean gone for ever?**
 
His mercy endureth for ever. -- The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy. -- Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity? ... he re-aineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sin into the depths of the sea. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us.
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
 
A merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.  

**Psa 77:8; Psa 136:23; Num 14:18; Mic 7:18,19; Tit 3:5; 2 Cor 1:3,4; Heb 2:17,15**
