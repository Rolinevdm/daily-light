# Morning

**In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.**
 
I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
 
When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  

**Phl 4:6; Psa 16:1,2; Matt 6:7; Rom 8:26; 1 Tim 2:8; Eph 6:18; Matt 18:19**

# Evening

**All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.**
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. -- I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. -- Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
 
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
 
My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
 
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created.  

**Psa 145:10; Psa 103:1,2; Psa 34:1; Psa 145:2; Psa 63:3-5; Luke 1:46,47; Rev 4:11**
