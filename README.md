# Morning

**We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.**
 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- Ye thought evil against me: but God meant it unto good.
 
All things are your's; whether ... the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- All things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
 
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.  

**Rom 8:28; Psa 76:10; Gen 50:20; 1 Cor 3:21-23; 2 Cor 4:15-17; Jas 1:2-4**

# Evening

**The communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.**
 
I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. -- He shall not speak of himself. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
 
The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. -- Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
 
Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. -- The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we would pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  

**2 Cor 13:14; John 14:16,17; John 16:13,14; Rom 5:5; 1 Cor 6:17; 1 Cor 6:19; Eph 4:30; Rom 8:26**
