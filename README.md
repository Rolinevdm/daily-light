# Morning

**The kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared.**
 
I have loved thee with an everlasting love.
 
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
 
When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. -- The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. -- Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.
 
As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.  

**Tit 3:4; Jer 31:3; 1 John 4:9,10; Gal 4:4,5; John 1:14; 1 Tim 3:16; Heb 2:14**

# Evening

**Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.**
 
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Serve the LORD with gladness; come before his presence with singing. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. -- For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
He ... spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. -- Having yet ... one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him.
 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
 
My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  

**2 Cor 9:15; Psa 100:1,2,4; Isa 9:6,7; Rom 8:32; Mark 12:6; Psa 107:21; Psa 103:1; Luke 1:46,47**
