# Morning

**As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.**
 
Our Saviour Jesus Christ, ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. -- I am the resurrection, and the life. -- Because I live, ye shall live also. -- We are made partakers of Christ. -- Partakers of the Holy Ghost. -- Partakers of the divine nature. -- The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. -- Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. -- Who liveth for ever and ever. -- The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality. -- Unto the King eternal, immortal, ... be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

**Let us not be desirous of vain glory.**
 
Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
 
Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not. -- Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.
 
Let nothing be done, through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. -- Charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own.
 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.  

**Gal 5:26; Judg 8:24,25,27; Jer 45:5; 2 Cor 12:7; Phl 2:3; 1 Cor 13:4,5; Matt 11:29**
