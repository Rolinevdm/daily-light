# Morning

**Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it.**
 
He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in right-eousness.
 
We glory in tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. -- If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons, for what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.  

**John 15:2; Mal 3:2,3; Rom 5:3; Heb 12:7,8,11,12**

# Evening

**Now we call the proud happy.**
 
Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
 
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. -- Blessed are the poor in spirit for their's is the kingdom of heaven.
 
These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: a proud look, ... . -- Every one that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord.
 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
 
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you. -- Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.  

**Mal 3:15; Isa 57:15; Prov 16:19; Matt 5:3; Prov 6:16,17; Prov 16:5; Psa 139:23,24; Phl 1:2,3; Matt 5:5**
