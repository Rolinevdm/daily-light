# Morning

**Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.**
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. -- After that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.
 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  

**Heb 11:1; 1 Cor 15:19; 1 Cor 2:9,10; Eph 1:13,14; John 20:29; 1 Pet 1:8,9; 2 Cor 5:7; Heb 10:35**

# Evening

**It is I; be not afraid.**
 
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
 
Woe is me! for I am undone; ... mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
 
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.  

**John 6:20; Rev 1:17,18; Isa 43:25; Isa 6:5â€‘7; Isa 44:22; 1 John 2:1**
