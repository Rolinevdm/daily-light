# Morning

**I delight in the law of God after the inward man.**
 
O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. -- Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart. -- I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. -- I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
 
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. -- My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
 
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyes. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. -- Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.  

**Rom 7:22; Psa 119:97; Jer 15:16; Song 2:3; Job 23:12; Psa 40:8; John 4:34; Psa 19:8,10; Jas 1:22,23**

# Evening

**The Lord thy God accept thee.**
 
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
 
We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. -- There is none righteous, no, not one. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemp-ion that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. To declare ... at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 
Accepted in the Beloved. -- Ye are complete in him.  

**2 Sam 24:23; Mic 6:6-8; Isa 64:6; Rom 3:10,23-26; Eph 1:6; Col 2:10**
