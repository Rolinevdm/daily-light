# Morning

**Your work of faith.**
 
This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
 
Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. -- Faith worketh by love. -- He that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. -- We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. -- Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
 
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth. Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power. -- It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

# Evening

**Where is the promise of his coming?**
 
Enoch ... the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all. -- Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.
 
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
 
The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.  

**2 Pet 3:4; Jude 14,15; Rev 1:7; 1 Thes 4:16,17; Tit 2:11-13**
