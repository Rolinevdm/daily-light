# Morning

**If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will. And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.**
 
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. -- Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. -- We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. -- A ransom for many.
 
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. -- I will love them freely. -- The Son of God ... loved me and gave himself for me.
 
He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -- He hath made us accepted in the beloved.  

**Lev 1:3,4; Gen 22:8; John 1:29; Heb 10:10; Matt 20:28; John 10:18; Hos 14:4; Gal 2:20; 2 Cor 5:21; Eph 1:6**

# Evening

**Great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.**
 
Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
 
Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins, -- They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: for the redemption of their soul is precious. -- I have found a ransom. -- God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.
 
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
