# Morning

**The Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.**
 
Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. -- Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. -- Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
 
Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall he added unto you.
 
As long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper. -- Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.
 
Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side?  

**Gen 39:3; Psa 128:1,2; Psa 37:3,4; Josh 1:9; Matt 6:33; 2 Chr 26:5; Deut 8:11,17; 1 Chr 22:18**

# Evening

**Why reason ye these things in your hearts?**
 
Being not weak in faith, [Abraham] considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb; he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.
 
Is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? -- If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
 
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. -- Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? -- Behold the fowls of the air; ... your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? -- Why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? Do ye not ... remember the five loaves of the five thousand?
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  

**Mark 2:8; Rom 4:19,20; Mark 2:9; Mark 9:23; Matt 28:18; Mark 4:40; Matt 6:26; Matt 16:8,9; Phl 4:19**
