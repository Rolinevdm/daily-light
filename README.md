# Morning

**I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but thou shouldest keep them from the evil.**
 
Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. -- Ye are the salt of the earth, ... the light of the world. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is heaven.
 
I also withheld thee from sinning against me.
 
The Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. -- So did not I, because of the fear of God. -- Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father. -- Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.  

**John 17:15; Phl 2:15; Matt 5:13,14; Matt 5:16; Gen 20:6; 2 Thes 3:3; Neh 5:15; Gal 1:4; Jude 24,25**

# Evening

**Whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe. (Or, set on high)**
 
The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high. -- The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; that he may set him with princes.
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  

**Prov 29:25; Isa 33:5; Psa 113:4,7,8; Eph 2:4â€‘6; Rom 8:32,38,39**
