# Morning

**The Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.**
 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. -- When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that wait for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. -- I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
 
The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. -- Blessed is the man that trustesth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.
 
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  

**Prov 3:26; Psa 76:10; Prov 21:1; Prov 16:7; Psa 130:5,6; Psa 34:4; Deut 33:27; Jer 17:7; Rom 8:31**

# Evening

**Consolation in Christ, ... comfort of love, ... fellowship of the Spirit.**
 
Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. -- My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
 
The Father ... shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name. -- Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
 
If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  

**Phl 2:1; Job 14:1,2; Psa 73:26; John 14:16,26; 2 Cor 1:3,4; 1 Thes 4:14,17,18**
