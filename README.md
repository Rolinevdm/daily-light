# Morning

**He that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.**
 
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. -- Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy. -- Hallowed be thy name.
 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people.
 
Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. -- I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
 
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, ... be glory.  

**Luke 1:49; Exo 15:11; Psa 86:8; Rev 15:4; Matt 6:9; Luke 1:68; Isa 63:1; Psa 89:19; Eph 3:20,21**

# Evening

**The dew of Hermon.**
 
Mount Sion, which is Hermon. -- There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. -- I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
 
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass. -- As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
 
God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. -- And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. -- It is like the precious ointment upon the head ... even Aaron's ... that went down to the skirts of his garments.  

**Psa 133:3; Deut 4:48; Psa 133:3; Hos 14:5; Deut 32:2; Isa 55:10,11; John 3:34; John 1:16; Psa 133:2**
