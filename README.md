# Morning

**Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.**
 
Jehovah Nissi (The Lord my banner). -- When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
 
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. -- The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- The captain of our salvation.
 
My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. -- Valiant for the truth. -- Fight the Lord's battles. -- Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: fear ye not. -- Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. -- Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

# Evening

**One thing is needful.**
 
There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
 
As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. -- O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.
 
I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. Lord, evermore give us this bread. -- Mary ... sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. -- One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.  

**Luke 10:42; Psa 4:6,7; Psa 42:1,2; Psa 63:1; John 6:35,34; Luke 10:39; Psa 27:4**
