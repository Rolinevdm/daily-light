# Morning

**Praying in the Holy Ghost.**
 
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. -- We ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
 
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
 
The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. -- When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.
 
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication.  

**Jude 20; John 4:24; Eph 2:18; Matt 26:39; Rom 8:26,27; 1 John 5:14; John 16:13; Eph 6:18**

# Evening

**There is a hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.**
 
A bruised reed shall he not break. -- He restoreth my soul.
 
Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. -- No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
 
Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. -- After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this.
 
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me. He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.  

**Job 14:7; Isa 42:3; Psa 23:3; 2 Cor 7:10; Heb 12:11; Psa 119:67; Ezra 9:13; Mic 7:8,9**
