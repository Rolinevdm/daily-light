# Morning

**The fruit of the Spirit is ... faith.**
 
By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. -- Without faith it is impossible to please him. -- He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
 
Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. -- Faith worketh by love. -- Faith without works is dead.
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.  

**Gal 5:22; Eph 2:8; Heb 11:6; John 3:18; Mark 9:24; 1 John 2:5; Gal 5:6; Jas 2:20; 2 Cor 5:7; Gal 2:20; 1 Pet 1:8,9**

# Evening

**The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.**
 
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. -- The Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
 
He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. -- As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
 
His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick. -- The same yesterday, and today, and forever.
 
The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. Fear ye not therefore.  

**Jas 5:11; Psa 103:13; Psa 111:4,5; Psa 121:3,4; Deut 32:11,12; Lam 3:22,23; Matt 14:14; Heb 13:8; Matt 10:30,29,31**
