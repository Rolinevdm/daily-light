# Morning

**My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.**
 
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. -- The gospel of Christ ... is the power of God unto salvation.
 
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. -- We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
 
The joy of the Lord is your strength. -- Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.  

**Eph 6:10; 2 Cor 12:9,10; Psa 71:16; Rom 1:16; Phl 4:13; Col 1:29; 2 Cor 4:7; Neh 8:10; Col 1:11**

# Evening

**Jesus Christ our Lord.**
 
Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. -- He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.
 
Messias ... which is called Christ. -- The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives.
 
The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. The second man is the Lord from heaven. -- My Lord and my God. -- Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  

**1 Cor 1:9; Matt 1:21; Phl 2:8‑10; John 4:25; Isa 61:1; 1 Cor 15:45,47; John 20:28; John 13:13‑15**
