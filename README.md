# Morning

**Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. **
 
Whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
 
Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might: ... but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD. -- The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.
 
What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. -- In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. -- Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
 
Christ Jesus, ... is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
 
He that winneth souls is wise.  

**Prov 3:13; Prov 8:35; Jer 9:23,24; Prov 9:10; Phl 3:7,8; Col 2:3; Prov 8:14; 1 Cor 1:30; Prov 1:30**

# Evening

**Poor, yet making many rich.**
 
Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. -- Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. -- My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.
 
Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? -- Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.
 
We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.  

**2 Cor 6:10; 2 Cor 8:9; John 1:16; Phl 4:19; 2 Cor 9:8; Jas 2:5; 1 Cor 1:26,27; 2 Cor 4:7**
