# Morning

**As thy days, so shall thy strength be.**
 
When they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. -- Take no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
 
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.  

**Deut 33:25; Matt 13:11; Matt 6:34; Psa 68:35; Isa 40:29; 2 Cor 12:9,10; Phl 4:13; Judg 5:21**

# Evening

**Awake, O north wind, and ... blow upon my garden, that the the spices thereof may flow out.**
 
No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- The fruit of the Spirit.
 
He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
 
Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
 
Though [Jesus] were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the the things which he suffered. -- In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  

**Song 4:16; Heb 12:11; Gal 5:22; Isa 27:8; Psa 103:13; 2 Cor 4:16; Heb 5:8; Heb 4:15**
