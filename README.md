# Morning

**I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth.**
 
It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if l depart, I will send him unto you.
 
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. -- Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  

**John 14:16,17; John 16:7; Rom 8:16; Rom 8:15; Rom 8:26; Rom 15:13; Rom 5:5; 1 John 4:13**

# Evening

**Shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?**
 
There remaineth ... a rest to the people of God. -- My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. -- There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. -- They ... rest from their labours.
 
The forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. -- In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  

**Ruth 3:1; Heb 4:9; Isa 32:18; Job 3:17; Rev 14:13; Heb 6:20; Matt 11:28-30; Isa 30:15; Psa 23:1,2**
