# Morning

**When Chrlst, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.**
 
I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. -- God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. -- When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
 
If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  

**Col 3:4; John 11:25; 1 John 5:11,12; 1 Thes 4:16-18; 1 John 32; 1 Cor 15:43; John 14:3**

# Evening

**Lead me in thy truth, and teach me**
 
When ... the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth. -- Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
 
To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. -- All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. -- The holy Scriptures ... are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. -- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. -- The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.  

**Psa 25:5; John 16:13; 1 John 2:20; Isa 8:20; 2 Tim 3:16,17; 2 Tim 3:15; Psa 32:8; Matt 6:22; John 7:17; Isa 35:8**
