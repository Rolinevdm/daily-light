# Morning

**Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.**
 
Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and I have nothing to set before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
 
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. -- As a prince hast thou power with God and with men. -- Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.
 
[Jesus] went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.  

**Luke 18:1; Luke 11:5â€‘8; Eph 6:18; Gen 32:26,28; Col 4:2; Luke 6:12**

# Evening

**Forgive all my sins.**
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
 
Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
 
The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins. -- In Whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- Having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul, ... who forgives all thine iniquities.  

**Psa 25:18; Isa 1:18; Matt 9:2; Isa 43:25; Matt 9:6; Eph 1:7; Tit 3:5,6; Col 2:13,14; Psa 103:2,3**
