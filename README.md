# Morning

**The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.**
 
Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. -- For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
 
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. -- Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. -- According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.

# Evening

**I am ... the bright and morning Star.There shall come a star out of Jacob.**
 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bethel.
 
Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
 
I am the light of the world. -- I will give him the morning star.
 
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: ... lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
