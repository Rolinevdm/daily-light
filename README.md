# Morning

**He led them forth by the right way.**
 
He found [Jacob] in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him. -- Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
 
The Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. -- For this GOD is our GOD for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death. Who teacheth like him?  

**Psa 107:7; Deut 32:10; Isa 46:4; Psa 23:3,4; Isa 58:11; Psa 48:14; Job 36:22**

# Evening

**What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ... Lord, that I may receive my sight.**
 
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
 
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. -- The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, ... shall teach you all things. -- Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.
 
The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, ... give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.  

**Luke 18:41; Psa 119:18; Luke 24:45; Eph 1:17**
