# Morning

**Everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shalI be clean.**
 
The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul. -- He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. -- Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
 
I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin. -- I will melt them. and try them.
 
Thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. We went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
 
When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.  

**Num 31:23; Deut 13:3; Mal 3:3; 1 Cor 3:13; Isa 1:25; Jer 9:7; Psa 66:10,12; Isa 43:2**

# Evening

**We, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.**
 
Put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts: and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
 
Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. -- As Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.  

**1 Pet 2:24; Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:3; Rom 6:4,6,7,11â€‘13**
