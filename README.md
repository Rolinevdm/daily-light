# Morning

**I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.**
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost.
 
The Lord taketh pleasure in his people. -- My delights were with the sons of men. -- His great love wherewith he loved us. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
 
Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in you body, and in your spirit, which are God's. -- Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.  

**Song 7:10; 2 Tim 1:12; Rom 8:38,39; John 17:12; Psa 149:4; Prov 8:31; Eph 2:4; John 15:13; 1 Cor 6:20; Rom 14:8**

# Evening

**Seek ye out of the book of the Lord.**
 
Ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. -- This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
 
The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. -- By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. -- Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
 
We have ... a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. -- That we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.  

**Isa 34:16; Deut 11:18; Josh 1:8; Psa 37:31; Psa 17:4; Psa 119:11; 2 Pet 1:19; Rom 15:4**
