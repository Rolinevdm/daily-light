# Morning

**Adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.**
 
Let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. -- Be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
 
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart; so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. -- Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.  

**Tit 2:10; Phl 1:27; 1 Thes 5:22; 1 Pet 4:14,15; Phl 2:15; Matt 5:16; Prov 3:3,4; Phl 4:8**

# Evening

**The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.**
 
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth. -- The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
 
Christ ... loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.
 
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. Thy word hath quickened me. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. I will not forget thy word. I trust in thy word. The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  

**John 6:63; Jas 1:18; 2 Cor 3:6; Eph 5:25â€‘27; Psa 119:9,50,11,16,42,72,93,103,104**
