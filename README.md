# Morning

**What profit is there of circumcision?**
 
Much every way. -- Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart. -- If ... their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember.
 
Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers. -- In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ. -- You, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.
 
Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness.  

**Rom 3:1; Rom 3:2; Jer 4:4; Lev 26:41,42; Rom 15:8; Col 2:11; Col 2:13; Eph 4:22‑24**

# Evening

**The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.**
 
The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. -- The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
 
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.
 
A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; let us draw near.  

**Matt 27:51; 1 Cor 11:23,24; John 6:51; John 6:53,54,56,57,61‑63; Heb 10:20,22**
