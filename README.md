# Morning

**The Lord is in the midst of thee.**
 
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. -- Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; He will come and save you. -- The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. -- Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart.
 
I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.  

**Zeph 3:15; Isa 41:10; Isa 35:3,4; Zeph 3:17; Psa 27:14; Rev 21:3,4**

# Evening

**Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.**
 
Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. -- We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night.
 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD.
 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. -- Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. -- Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.
 
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.  

**Exo 14:15; 1 Chr 19:13; Neh 4:9; Matt 7:21; John 7:17; Hos 6:3; Matt 26:41; 1 Cor 16:13; Rom 12:11; Isa 35:3,4**
