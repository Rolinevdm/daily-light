# Morning

**Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.**
 
Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. -- We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope.
 
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. -- Ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. -- Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts.

**James 1:4; 1 Pet 1:6,7; Rom 5:3-4; Lam 3:26; Heb 10: 34-36; 2Th 2:16-17**

# Evening

**God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.**
 
Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. -- The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: -- because he is the Son of man. -- The Son of God, -- hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire.
 
They say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?--These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. -- There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
 
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. -- Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

**Rom 2:16; 1Cor 4:5; Joh 5:22,27; Rev 2:18; Ps 73:11; Ps 50:21; Lu 12:2; Ps 38:9; Ps 26:2**
