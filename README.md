# Morning

**If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.**
 
I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.
 
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. -- I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. -- Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. -- God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- That he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 
Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. -- They shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
 
This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood.  

**1 John 1:9; Psa 51:3,4; Luke 15:20; Isa 44:22; 1 John 2:12; Eph 4:32; Rom 3:26; Eze 36:25; Rev 3:4; 1 John 5:6**

**Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee?**
 
Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
 
The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. -- An high priest ... holy, harmless, undefiled.
 
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. -- The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
 
Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  

**Psa 94:20; 1 John 1:3; 1 John 3:2,3; John 14:30; Heb 7:26; Eph 6:12; Eph 2:2; 1 John 5:18,19**
