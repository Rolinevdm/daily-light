# Morning

**They shall put my name upon the childen of Isael; and I will bless them.**
 
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. -- We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
 
All people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. -- The LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
 
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. -- Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? -- The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  

**Num 6:27; Isa 26:13; Isa 63:19; Deut 28:10; 1 Sam 12:22; Dan 9:19; Psa 79:9,10; Prov 18:10**

# Evening

**The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.**
 
The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. -- He left not himself without witness. -- Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
 
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. -- They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.  

**Psa 19:1; Rom 1:20; Acts 14:17; Psa 19:2,3; Psa 8:3,4; 1 Cor 15:41,42; Dan 12:3**
