# Morning

**The joy of the Lord is your strength.**
 
Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth with singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted. -- Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. -- The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. -- My soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ those things which pertain to God. -- We ... joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. -- I will joy in the God of my salvation.

# Evening

**He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure.**
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.
 
We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
