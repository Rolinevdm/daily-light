# Morning

**It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.**
 
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? -- I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
 
Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. -- Wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. -- Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
 
Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: ... in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.  

**Lam 3:26; Psa 77:9; Psa 31:22; Luke 18:7,8; Prov 20:22; Psa 37:7; 2 Chr 20:17; Gal 6:9; Jas 5:7**

# Evening

**Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.**
 
Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. -- Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. -- Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
 
He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ. -- The tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. -- Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt.  

**Song 2:15; Psa 19:12; Heb 12:15; Gal 5:7; Phl 1:6,27; Jas 3:5,6; Col 4:6**
