# Morning

**Be not far from me; for trouble is near.**
 
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? -- Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
 
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. -- The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
 
I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. -- Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. -- Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. -- My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

# Evening

**Hallowed be thy name.**
 
Thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
 
Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
 
Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. -- I saw ... the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone. -- I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself.
 
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- That we might be partakers of his holiness. -- Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart.
