# Morning

**If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only.**
 
Little children, keep yourselves from idols. -- Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. -- Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.
 
Thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. -- Serve him with a perfect heart with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.
 
Behold, thou desireth truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. -- Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. -- Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.  

**1 Sam 7:3; 1 John 5:21; 2 Cor 6:17,18; Matt 6:24; Exo 34:14; 1 Chr 28:9; Psa 51:6; 1 Sam 16:7; 1 John 3:21**

# Evening

**When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?**
 
He came unto his own, and his own received him not. -- The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall from the faith.
 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables.
 
Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. -- Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching. -- Looking for that blessed hope, ... the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,  

**Luke 18:8; John 1:11; 1 Tim 4:1; 2 Tim 4:2-4; Mark 13:32,33; Luke 12:37; Tit 2:13**
