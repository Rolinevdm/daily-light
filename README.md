# Morning

**Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.**
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. -- Whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. -- Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? -- The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
 
Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. -- We desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and perseverence inherit the promises. -- So run, that ye may obtain.  

**Rom 12:11; Eccl 9:10; Col 3:23,24; Eph 6:8; John 9:4; Luke 2:49; John 2:17; 2 Pet 1:10; Heb 6:11,12; 1 Cor 9:24**

**Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.**
 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
 
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. -- Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
 
Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, ... even as the garden of the LORD. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. -- [The Lord] delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations. -- Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
