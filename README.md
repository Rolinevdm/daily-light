# Morning

**He will rest in his love.**
 
The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loved you. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- You ... hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.
 
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. -- God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
 
Look, at a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. -- His son ... who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.  

**Zeph 3:17; Deut 7:7,8; 1 John 4:19; Col 1:21,22; 1 John 4:10; Rom 5:8; Matt 3:17; John 10:17; Heb 1:2,3**

# Evening

**A new and living way.**
 
Cain went out from the presence of the Lord. -- Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you. -- Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord.
 
I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
 
The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing. -- He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us. -- The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
 
Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. -- Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.  

**Heb 10:20; Gen 4:16; Isa 59:2; Heb 12:14; John 14:6; 2 Tim 1:10; Heb 9:8; Eph 2:14; Matt 27:51; Matt 7:14; Psa 16:11**
