# Morning

**I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.**
 
In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. -- She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 
The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- If by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. -- Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ, ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
 
God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. -- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  

**John 10:10; Gen 2:17; Gen 3:6; Rom 6:23; Rom 5:17; 1 Cor 15:21-22; 2 Tim 1:10; 1 John 5:11-12; John 3:17**

# Evening

**The judgment seat.**
 
We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth. -- When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.
 
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. -- There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
 
We are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  

**2 Cor 5:10; Rom 2:2; Matt 25:31-32; Matt 13:43; Rom 8:33-34; Rom 8:1; 1 Cor 11:32**
