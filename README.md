# Morning

**Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.**
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil. -- There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
 
In Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace.
 
It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell: and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself. -- Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past: ... that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
 
Trust ye in the LORD for ever, for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.  

**Isa 27:5; Jer 29:11; Isa 48:22; Eph 2:13,14; Col 1:19,20; Rom 3:24-26; 1 John 1:9; Isa 26:4**

# Evening

**God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.**
 
As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
 
I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. -- I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. -- No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life. -- For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
