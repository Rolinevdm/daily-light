# Morning

**I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee.**
 
[Moses] stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word of the Lord: for ye were afraid. -- There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
 
Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth. -- Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. -- Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.
 
Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

# Evening

**Everlasting consolation.**
 
I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
 
By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. -- He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. -- Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? -- The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. -- So shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore cormfort one another with these words.
 
This is not your rest. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
