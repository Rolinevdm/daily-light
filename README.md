# Morning

**His name shall be called Wonderful.**
 
The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. -- Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
 
They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. -- JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
 
All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. -- God ... hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. -- Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet. -- He had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself ... KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
 
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out. -- What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?  

**Isa 9:6; John 1:14; Psa 138:2; Matt 1:23; Matt 1:21; John 5:23; Phl 29; Eph 1:21,22; Rev 19:12,16; Job 37:23; Prov 30:4**

# Evening

**The Lord's portion is his people.**
 
Ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. -- I am his. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. -- The Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.
 
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. -- Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. -- A spiritual house, an holy priesthood.
 
They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels. -- All mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. -- The glory of his inheritance in the saints.
