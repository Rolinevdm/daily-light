# Morning

**To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.**
 
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
 
We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
 
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
 
Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.  

**Prov 11:18; Matt 25:19â€‘21; 2 Cor 5:10; 2 Tim 4:7,8; Rev 3:11**

# Evening

**God is faithful.**
 
God is not a man that he should lie; neither the Son of man that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? -- The Lord sware and will not repent.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. -- Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day -- Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. -- All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.  

**1 Cor 10:13; Num 23:19; Heb 7:21; Heb 6:17,18; 1 Pet 4:19; 2 Tim 1:12; 1 Thes 5:24; 2 Cor 1:20**
