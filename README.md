# Morning

**As the body is one, and hath many members, ... so also is Christ.**
 
He is the head of the body, the church. -- The head over things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. -- We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
 
A body hast thou prepared me. -- Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in contin-uance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
 
Thine they were, and thou gavest them me. -- He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.
 
Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth ... maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.  

**1 Cor 12:12; Col 1:18; Eph 1:22,23; Eph 5:30; Heb 10:5; Psa 139:16; John 17:6; Eph 1:4; Rom 8:29; Eph 4:15,16**

# Evening

**The fountain of living waters.**
 
How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life.
 
Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. -- Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. -- This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.
 
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters. -- The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.  

**Jer 2:13; Psa 36:7-9; Isa 65:13; John 4:14; John 7:39; Isa 55:1; Rev 22:17**
