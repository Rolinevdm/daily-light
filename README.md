# Morning

**The meek will he teach his way.**
 
Blessed are the meek.
 
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill. -- A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God. -- Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
 
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
 
When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.  

**Psa 25:9; Matt 5:5; Eccl 9:11; Prov 16:9; Psa 123:1,2; Psa 143:8; 2 Chr 20:12; Jas 1:5; John 16:13**

# Evening

**O Lord God, ... with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.**
 
Thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever. -- The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
 
Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. -- When thou makest a feast call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. -- Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
 
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
 
The LORD God is a sun and shield.
