# Morning

**Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide.**
 
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.
 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? -- The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
 
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. -- This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night. -- My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.  

**Gen 24:63; Psa 19:14; Psa 8:3,4; Psa 111:2; Psa 1:1,2; Josh 1:8; Psa 63:5,6**

# Evening

**How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord! for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?**
 
Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
 
Thou shalt not be forgotten of me. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins.
 
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. -- A woman ... cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David! But he answered her not a word.
 
The trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth.  

**Psa 13:1; Jas 1:17; Isa 49:14,15; Isa 44:21,22; John 11:5,6; Matt 15:22,23; 1 Pet 1:7**
