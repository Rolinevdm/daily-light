# Morning

**It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.**
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. -- I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. -- We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering an offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. -- Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
 
I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  

**John 19:30; Heb 12:2; John 17:4; Heb 10:10-14; Col 2:14; John 10:17,18; John 15:13**

# Evening

**He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.**
 
He brought me up ... out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. -- You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world. We all had our conversation in times past in the lusts our flesh.
 
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed. -- Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. -- We went through fire and through water: thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
 
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.  

**Psa 18:16; Psa 40:2; Eph 2:1,3; Psa 61:1,2; Jon 2:2,3; Psa 66:12; Isa 43:2**
