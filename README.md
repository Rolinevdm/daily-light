# Morning

**O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.**
 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God. -- Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. -- Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storms.
 
Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.  

**Psa 38:14; Psa 123:1,2; Psa 61:1‑4; Isa 25:4; 1 Pet 2:21‑23**

# Evening

**Fight the good fight of faith.**
 
We were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. -- Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. -- Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
 
Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. -- God is my strength and power: ... he teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. -- Our sufficiency is of God.
 
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. -- Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
 
The time would fail me to tell of [those] who through faith subdued kingdoms, ... out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
