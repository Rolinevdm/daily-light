# Morning

**Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.**
 
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
 
His Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
 
I and my Father are one. The Father is in me, and I in him. -- My Father, and your Father; and ... my God, and your God. -- I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.
 
The Church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
 
Having ... these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.  

**John 1:16; Matt 17:5; 1 John 3:1; Heb 1:2; Rom 8:17; John 10:30,38; John 20:17; John 17:23; Eph 1:22,23; 2 Cor 7:1**

# Evening

**The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.**
 
There was ... a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. -- Even the Son man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
 
Jesus riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.  

**John 13:16,17; Luke 22:24-27; Matt 20:28; John 13:3-5**
