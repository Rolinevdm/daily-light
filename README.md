# Morning

**The fruit of the Spirit is love.**
 
God is love: and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. -- The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. -- Unto you ... which believe he is precious. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
 
Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. -- This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. -- Above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. -- Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.  

**Gal 5:22; 1 John 4:16; Rom 5:5; 1 Pet 2:7; 1 John 4:19; 2 Cor 5:14,15; 1 Thes 4:9; John 15:12; 1 Pet 4:8; Eph 5:2**

# Evening

**Jehovahâ€‘nissi: The Lord my banner.**
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
 
Behold, God himself is with us for our captain. -- The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
 
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. -- Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.  

**Exo 17:15; Rom 8:31; Psa 118:6; Psa 60:4; Psa 27:1,3; 2 Chr 13:12; Psa 46:7; Rev 17:14; Psa 2:1,4; Isa 8:10**
