# Morning

**I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.**
 
So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
 
Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. -- Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
 
Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world. At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me. -- When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.
 
Look, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. -- I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore. -- I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. -- My peace I give unto you.  

**Heb 13:5; Heb 13:6; Gen 28:15; Deut 31:6; 2 Tim 4:10,16,17; Psa 27:10; Matt 28:20; Rev 1:18; John 14:18; John 14:27**

# Evening

**Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.**
 
All power is give unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: ... and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea.
 
Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not gospel! I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- My word ... shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. -- So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  

**Luke 5:5; Matt 28:18â€‘20; Matt 13:47; 1 Cor 9:16,22; Gal 6:9; Isa 55:11; 1 Cor 3:7**
