# Morning

**My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.**
 
How precious ... are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. -- How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! -- Thy love is better than wine.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. -- Thou art fairer than the children of men.
 
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. -- His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.  

**Psa 63:5,6; Psa 139:17,18; Psa 119:103; Song 1:2; Psa 73:25; Psa 45:2; Song 2:3,4; Song 5:15,16**

# Evening

**Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.**
 
I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. -- I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases. -- He restoreth my soul. -- O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
 
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.
 
I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  

**Psa 51:12; Isa 57:18; Isa 1:18; Jer 3:22; Psa 85:8; Psa 103:2,3; Psa 23:3; Isa 12:1; Psa 119:117; Isa 43:25**
