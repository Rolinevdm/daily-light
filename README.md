# Morning

**Mine eyes fail with looking upward.**
 
Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. -- My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. -- My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
 
Ye have need of patience.
 
While they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. -- Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. -- That blessed hope,... the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.  

**Isa 38:14; Psa 6:2‑4; Psa 55:4‑6; Heb 10:36; Acts 1:10,11‑phl 3:20; Tit 2:13**

# Evening

**His name shall be in their foreheads.**
 
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep. -- The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
 
The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. -- Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
 
After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance. -- Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
 
I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. -- This is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.  

**Rev 22:4; John 10:14; 2 Tim 2:19; Nah 1:7, ‑rev 7:3; Eph 1:13,14; 2 Cor 1:21,22; Rev 3:12; Jer 33:16**
