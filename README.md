# Morning

**From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard.**
 
Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. -- The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. -- Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. -- God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God.
 
Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.  

**Dan 10:12; Isa 57:15; Psa 51:17; Psa 138:6; Prov 5:6; Jas 4:6; Jas 4:7; Psa 86:5-7**

# Evening

**Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.**
 
Understanding what the will of the Lord is.
 
It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
 
This is the will of God, even your sanctification. -- That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. -- Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth: wherefore lay apart all filthiness.
 
Be ye holy; for I am holy. -- [Jesus] said, Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. -- Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  

**Matt 6:10; Eph 5:17; Matt 18:14; 1 Thes 4:3; 1 Pet 4:2; Jas 1:18,21; 1 Pet 1:16; Mark 3:34,35; Matt 7:24,25; 1 John 2:17**
