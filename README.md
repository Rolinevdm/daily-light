# Morning

**Fear not; I am the first and the last.**
 
Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, but ye are come unto mount Sion, ... to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant. -- Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. -- We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
 
Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, aud his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. -- The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One? -- Who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?  

**Rev 1:17; Heb 12:18,22â€‘24; Heb 12:2; Heb 4:15,16; Isa 44:6; Isa 9:6; Hab 1:12; 2 Sam 22:32**

# Evening

**Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.**
 
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. -- He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. -- Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heaven.
 
Who is a rock save our God? -- They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. -- Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.  

**Psa 61:2; Phl 4:6,7; Psa 142:3; Job 23:10; Psa 90:1; Isa 25:4; Psa 18:31; John 10:28; Psa 119:116; Heb 6:19**
