# Morning

**Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.**
 
Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. -- Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
 
Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry ... Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
 
What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  

**Prov 27:1; 2 Cor 6:2; John 12:35,36; Eccl 9:10; Luke 12:19â€‘21; Jas 4:14; 1 John 2:17**

# Evening

**Thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. **
 
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. -- The same yesterday, and today, and forever.
 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
 
God is not a man, that he should lie: neither the son of man, that he should repent. -- It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
 
This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- Fear not; I am the first and the last.  

**Psa 102:27; Psa 90:2; Mal 3:6; Heb 13:8; Jas 1:17; Rom 11:29; Num 23:19; Lam 3:22; Heb 7:24,25; Rev 1:17**
