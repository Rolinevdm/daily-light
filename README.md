# Morning

**I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.**
 
A new heart ... will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you. -- Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
 
That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
 
I ... beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, ... endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.  

**Jer 32:39; Ezek 36:26; Psa 25:8-10; John 17:21; Eph 4:1-6**

# Evening

**They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. (Or, change strength.)**
 
When I am weak, then am I strong. -- God shall be my strength. -- He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. -- Let him take hold of my strength.
 
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee. -- The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.
 
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
 
Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. -- Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.  

**Isa 40:31; 2 Cor 12:10; Isa 49:5; 2 Cor 12:9; Isa 27:5; Psa 55:22; Gen 49:24; Gen 32:26; 1 Sam 17:45; Psa 35:1,2**
