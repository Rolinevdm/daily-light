# Morning

**If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ.**
 
If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
 
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. -- Thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. -- Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.
 
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me.
 
He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him I will give power over the nations. -- To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.  

**Rom 8:17; Gal 3:29; 1 John 3:l; Gal 4:7; Eph 1:5; John 17:24; Rev 2:26; Rev 3:21**

# Evening

**Things which are despised, hath God chosen.**
 
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
 
Jesus, ... saw two brethren, ... casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me. -- Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
 
My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
 
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God.  

**1 Cor 1:28; Acts 2:7; Matt 4:18,19; Acts 4:13; 1 Cor 2:4,5; John 15:16,5; 2 Cor 4:7**
