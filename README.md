# Morning

**Sing unto the Lord a new song.**
 
Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. -- He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.
 
Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. -- The joy of the Lord is your strength. -- Paul ... thanked God, and took courage.
 
Knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.  

**Isa 42:10; Psa 81:1,2; Psa 40:3; Josh 1:9; Neh 8:10; Acts 28:15; Rom 13:11**

# Evening

**Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.**
 
Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: ... and thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: ... and when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.
 
[Jesus] is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- The smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Pray without ceasing.  

**Psa 141:2; Exo 30:1; Heb 7:25; Rev 8:4; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Thes 5:17**
