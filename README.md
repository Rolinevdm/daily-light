# Morning

**Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.**
 
Get wisdom, get understanding. -- The wisdom that is from above. -- The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. -- We are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
 
Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. -- God ... hath quickened us together with Christ, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
 
They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. -- Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness.  

**Col 3:1; Prov 4:5; Jas 3:17; Job 28:14; Rom 6:4,5; Heb 12:1; Eph 2:4â€‘6; Heb 11:14; Zeph 2:3**

# Evening

**Nicodemus ... he that came to Jesus by night.**
 
Peter followed him afar off. -- Among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. -- The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.
 
Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench. -- Faith as a grain of mustard seed.
 
God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord. -- Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. -- Whosoever ... shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.  

**John 7:50; Matt 26:58; John 12:42,43; Prov 29:25; John 6:37; Isa 42:3; Matt 17:20; 2 Tim 1:7,8; 1 John 2:28; Matt 10:32**
