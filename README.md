# Morning

**The only wise God our Saviour.**
 
Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. -- Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
 
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory. -- The mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known, by the church, the manifold wisdom of God.
 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. -- The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  

**Jude 25; 1 Cor 1:30; Job 11:7,8; 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 3:9,10; Jas 1:5; Jas 3:17**

# Evening

**When shall I arise, and the night be gone?**
 
Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh.
 
Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds.
 
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you.
 
Let all thine enemies perish, O Lord; but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. -- Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
There shall be no night there.  

**Job 7:4; Isa 21:11,12; Heb 10:37; 2 Sam 23:4; John 14:2,3,27,28; Judg 5:31; 1 Thes 5:5; Rev 21:25**
