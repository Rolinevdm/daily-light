# Morning

**If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.**
 
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
 
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. -- The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. -- Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. -- My blood is drink indeed.
 
Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.  

**John 7:37; Psa 84:2; Psa 63:1,2; Isa 55:1; Rev 22:17; John 4:14; John 6:55; Song 5:1**

# Evening

**Ye are the salt of the earth**.
 
That which is not corruptible. -- Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. -- He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. -- The children of God, being the children of the resurrection. -- The uncorruptible God.
 
If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. -- It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
 
Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. -- Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.  

**Matt 5:13; 1 Pet 3:4; 1 Pet 1:23; John 11:25; Luke 20:36; Rom 1:23; Rom 5:9-11; 1 Cor 15:42; Mark 9:50; Eph 4:29**
