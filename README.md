# Morning

**Neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.**
 
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. -- Abhor that which is evil. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.
 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
 
Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. -- Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
 
Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. -- Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. -- In him is no sin.  

**Exo 13:7; Prov 8:13; Rom 12:9; 1 Thes 5:22; Heb 12:15; Psa 66:18; 1 Cor 5:6-8; 1 Cor 11:28; 2 Tim 2:19; Heb 7:26; 1 John 3:5**

# Evening

**The serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: ... your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.**
 
I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
 
My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. -- Lest Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.  

**Gen 3:4,5; 2 Cor 11:3; Eph 6:10,11,13-17; 2 Cor 2:11**
