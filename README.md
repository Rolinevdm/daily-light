# Morning

**As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation.**
 
Ye know how we exhorted ... and charged every one of you, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. -- Ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
 
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -- Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  

**1 Pet 1:15; 1 Thes 2:11,12; 1 Pet 2:9; Eph 5:8-11; Phl 1:11; Matt 5:16; 1 Cor 10:31**

# Evening

**Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.**
 
A new heart ... will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them.
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
 
Have faith in God. Verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  

**Isa 45:11; Ezek 36:26,27,37; Matt 18:19,20; Mark 11:22,23**
