# Morning

**Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.**
 
Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?
 
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. -- Born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
 
My Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. -- The battle is not yours, but God's.
 
The LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's.  

**Zech 4:6; Isa 40:13; 1 Cor 1:27-29; John 3:8; John 1:13; Hag 2:5; 2 Chr 20:15; 1 Sam 17:47**

# Evening

**Do as thou hast said.**
 
Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. Thy faithfulness is unto all generations.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.
 
Exceeding great and precious promises.  

**2 Sam 7:25; Psa 119:38,42,49,54,72,89,90; Heb 6:17-20; 2 Pet 1:4**
