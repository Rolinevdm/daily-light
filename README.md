# Morning

**Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.**
 
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. -- The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable. -- Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
 
What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. -- Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.  

**Matt 3:15; Psa 40:8; Matt 5:17,18; Isa 42:21; Matt 5:20; Rom 8:3,4; Rom 10:4**

# Evening

**I am thy part and thine inheritance.**
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee! and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. -- The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
 
The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is ... Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
 
My beloved is mine, and I am his.  

**Num 18:20; Psa 73:25,26; Psa 16:5,6; Lam 3:24; Psa 119:111; Psa 63:1,7; Song 2:16**
