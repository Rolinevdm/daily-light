# Morning

**Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins: and in him is no sin.**
 
God, ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high. -- He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
 
Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold; ... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.  

**1 John 3:5; Heb 1:13; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Pet 1:17; 2 Cor 5:14,15**

# Evening

**I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.**
 
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.
 
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sin. That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
 
The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him. -- Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
 
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.  

**Deut 30:19; Ezek 18:32; John 15:22; Luke 12:47; Rom 6:23; John 3:36; Rom 6:16; John 12:26**
