# Morning

**Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful.**
 
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. -- The longsuffering of our Lord is salvation.
 
For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. -- Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
 
Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? -- Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.  

**Neh 9:17; 2 Pet 3:9; 2 Pet 3:15; 1 Tim 1:16; Rom 15:4; Rom 2:4; Joel 2:13**

# Evening

**The words of the Lord are pure words.**
 
Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. -- The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. -- Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
 
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. -- Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. -- As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.
 
We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. -- Nor handling the word of God deceitfully.  

**Psa 12:6; Psa 119:140; Psa 19:8; Prov 30:5,6; Psa 119:11,15; Phl 4:8; 1 Pet 2:2; 2 Cor 2:17; 2 Cor 4:2**
