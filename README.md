# Morning

**Behold the Lamb of God.**
 
It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God. -- He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
 
Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, ... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: ... manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God ... that your faith and hope might be in God.
 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.  

**John 1:29; Heb 10:4‑7; Isa 53:7; 1 Pet 1:18‑21; Rev 5:12**

# Evening

**I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.**
 
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect. -- Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God. -- The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
 
I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. -- I will bless the Lord all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
 
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion. -- They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty. -- Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me. -- Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. -- Rejoice in the Lord, always; and again I say, Rejoice.  

**Psa 71:14; Phl 3:12; Heb 6:1; Prov 4:18; Psa 116:1,2; Psa 34:1; Psa 65:1; Rev 4:8; Psa 50:23; 1 Thes 5:16‑18; Phl 4:4**
