# Morning

**A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.**
 
A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked. -- Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. -- Godliness with contentment is great gain. Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
 
Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. -- Give us this day our daily bread.
 
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? -- When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. -- Let your conversation be without covetousness: and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  

**Luke 12:15; Psa 37:16; Prov 15:16; 1 Tim 6:6,8; Prov 30:8,9; Matt 6:11; Matt 6:25; Luke 22:35; Heb 13:5**

# Evening

**It is the spirit that quickeneth.**
 
The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. -- That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.
 
If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of right-eousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
 
I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God. -- Reckon ye ... yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  

**John 6:63; 1 Cor 15:45; John 3:6; Tit 3:5; Rom 8:9-11; Gal 2:20; Rom 6:11**
