# Morning

**Abide in me, and I in you.**
 
I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. -- If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard.
 
Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. -- He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  

**John 15:4; Gal 2:20; Rom 7:18,24,25; Rom 8:10; Col 1:23; 1 John 2:28; 1 John 2:6**

# Evening

**Dost thou believe on the Son of God?**
 
Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
 
The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. -- I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
 
Lord, I believe. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious.  

**John 9:35; John 9:36; Heb 1:3; 1 Tim 6:15,16; Rev 1:8; John 9:38; 2 Tim 1:12; 1 Pet 2:6,7**
