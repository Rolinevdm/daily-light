# Morning

**God shall wipe away all tears: ... there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, ... for the former things are passed away.**
 
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. -- Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. -- The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. -- The voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. -- Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
 
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction. -- The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
 
The things which are not seen are eternal.  

**Rev 21:4; Isa 25:8; Isa 60:20; Isa 33:24; Isa 65:19; Isa 35:10; Hos 13:14; 1 Cor 15:26,54; 2 Cor 4:18**

# Evening

**Raised up together in Christ Jesus.**
 
Fear not; ... I am he that liveth. -- Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.
 
We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. -- He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead. -- Ye are complete in him, which is the head.
 
Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
 
This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  

**Eph 2:6; Rev 1:17,18; John 17:24; Eph 5:30; Col 1:18; Col 2:10; Heb 2:14,15; 1 Cor 15:53,54**
