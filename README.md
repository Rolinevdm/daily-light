# Morning

**The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, and in this place will I give peace.**
 
The house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. -- The glory of the Lord ... filled the Lord's house.
 
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spake of the temple of his body. -- That which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth. -- The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. -- God ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
 
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. -- The Prince of Peace. -- He is our peace. -- The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  

**Hag 2:9; 1 Chr 22:5; 2 Chr 7:2; John 2:19,21; 2 Cor 3:10; John 1:14; Heb 1:1,2; Luke 2:14; Isa 9:6; Eph 2:14; Phl 4:7**

# Evening

**Let us put on the armour of light.**
 
Put ... on the Lord Jesus Christ. -- That I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. -- The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.
 
He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them. All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Awake thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly.  

**Rom 13:12; Rom 13:14; Phl 3:8,9; Rom 3:22; Isa 61:10; Psa 71:16; Eph 5:8,11,13-15**
