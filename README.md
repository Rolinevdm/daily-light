# Morning

**Take heed unto thyself.**
 
Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. -- Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
 
They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. -- For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. -- Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.  

**1 Tim 4:16; 1 Cor 9:25â€‘27; Eph 6:11,12; Gal 5:24,25; Rom 8:14; 1 Tim 4:15**

# Evening

**Jesus saith unto her, Mary.**
 
Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by name: Thou art mine. -- The sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name. And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
 
Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. -- We have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.
 
Thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial. And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment. And thou shalt set in it four rows of stones. And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, ... and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord.  

**John 20:16; Isa 43:1; John 10:3,4; Isa 49:16; 2 Tim 2:19; Heb 4:14; Exo 28:9,12,15,17,21,30**
