# Morning

**The free gift is of many offences unto justification.**
 
Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- Not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. -- And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  

**Rom 5:16; Isa 1:18; Isa 43:25,26; Isa 44:22; John 3:16; Rom 5:15; 1 Cor 6:11**

# Evening

**Occupy till I come.**
 
The Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. -- Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. -- Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? -- Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. -- Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it. -- Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  

**Luke 19:13; Mark 13:34; Matt 25:15; John 9:4; Luke 2:49; 1 Pet 2:21; 2 Tim 4:2; 1 Cor 3:13; 1 Cor 15:58**
