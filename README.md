# Morning

**Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.**
 
I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. -- Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
 
Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. -- If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
 
He saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. -- Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.  

**Psa 51:2; Jer 33:8; Ezek 36:25; John 3:5; Heb 9:13,14; Psa 106:8; Psa 115:1**

# Evening

**Fellowship in the gospel.**
 
As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
 
God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. -- That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
 
If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- These words spake Jesus. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.  

**Phl 1:5; 1 Cor 12:12,13; 1 Cor 1:9; 1 John 1:3; 1 John 1:7; John 17:1,20,21**
