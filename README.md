# Morning

**Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth.**
 
See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. -- I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. -- My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
 
I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. -- As a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee. -- Now no chastening for the present, seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.
 
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  

**Prov 3:12; Deut 32:39; Jer 29:11; Isa 55:8; Hos 2:14; Deut 8:5; Heb 12:11; 1 Pet 5:6; Psa 119:75**

# Evening

**The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.**
 
She did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold. Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and I will recover my wool and my flax.
 
All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord our God, all this store ... cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. -- Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
 
The living God ... giveth us richly all things to enjoy. -- Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  

**Psa 24:1; Hos 2:8,9; 1 Chr 29:14â€‘16; Rom 11:36; 1 Tim 6:17; 1 Tim 4:4,5; Phl 4:19**
