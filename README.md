# Morning

**Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.**
 
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
 
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. -- I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
 
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.  

**Isa 38:17; Mic 7:18,19; Isa 54:7,8; Jer 31:34; Psa 32:1,2; 1 John 1:7**

# Evening

**I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able.**
 
Able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. Able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work. Able to succour them that are tempted.
 
Able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. Able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.
 
Able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. Believe ye that I am able to do this? ... Yea, Lord. According to your faith be it unto you.  

**2 Tim 1:12; Eph 3:20; 2 Cor 9:8; Heb 2:18; Heb 7:25; Jude 24; 2 Tim 1:12; Phl 3:21; Matt 9:28,29**
