# Morning

**He led them on safely.**
 
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment.
 
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. -- In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
 
They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. -- So didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
 
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. -- O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

# Evening

**Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified.**
 
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- The chas-tisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
Christ ... loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. -- To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
 
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. -- Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
