# Morning

**We know that we have passed from death unto life.**
 
He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. -- He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
 
He which stablisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. -- Hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. -- We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
 
You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sin. -- Quickened ... together with Christ. -- Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom his dear Son.

# Evening

**Thou wilt shew me the path of life.**
 
Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. -- I will teach you the good and the right way. -- I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Follow me.
 
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the ends thereof are the ways of death. -- Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
 
An highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.
 
In my Fatherâ€™s house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
