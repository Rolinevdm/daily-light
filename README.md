# Morning

**Our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep.**
 
The chief Shepherd. -- I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
 
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity us all. -- I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. -- I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. -- Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.  

**Heb 13:20; 1 Pet 5:4; John 10:14,27, 28; Psa 23:1â€‘3; Isa 53:6; John 10:11; Ezek 34:16; 1 Pet 2:25**

# Evening

**The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.**
 
I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. -- Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. -- The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine ever-lasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
 
The God of all grace, ... hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.  

**Rev 21:23; Acts 26:13,15; Matt 17:1,2; Isa 60:19,20; 1 Pet 5:10**
