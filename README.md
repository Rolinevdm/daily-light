# Morning

**The Lord reigneth.**
 
Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? -- Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
 
He changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding. -- Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.  

**Psa 99:1; Jer 5:22; Psa 75:6,7; Dan 2:21; Matt 24:6; Rom 8:31; Matt 10:29-31**

# Evening

**Take heed to your spirit.**
 
Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he ... rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
 
Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. And Joshua the son of Nun ... answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. -- And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.  

**Mal 2:15; Luke 9:49,50,54,55; Num 11:27-29; Gal 5:22,23; Gal 5:24-27**
