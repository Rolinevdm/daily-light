# Morning

**Be strong and of a good courage.**
 
The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life: of whom shall I be afraid? -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. -- My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? -- Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
 
Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.  

**Josh 1:18; Psa 27:1; Isa 40:29‑31; Psa 73:26; Rom 8:31; Psa 118:6; Psa 44:5; Rom 8:37; 1 Chr 22:16**

# Evening

**Our friend sleepeth.**
 
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
 
If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
 
It came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones ... and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. -- This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. -- Witnesses chosen before of God, ... who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  

**John 11:11; 1 Thes 4:13,14; 1 Cor 15:16‑18,20; Josh 4:1,3,7; Acts 2:32; Acts 10:41**
