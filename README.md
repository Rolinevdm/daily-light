# Morning

**I know their sorrows.**
 
A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. -- Touched with the feeling of our infirmities.
 
Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. -- Jesus being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well.
 
When Jesus ... saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. Jesus wept. -- For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
 
He hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death. -- He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.
 
He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. -- In all their affliction he was afflicted; and the angel of his presence saved them.  

**Exo 3:7; Isa 53:3; Heb 4:15; Matt 8:17; John 4:6; John 11:33,35; Heb 2:18; Psa 102:19,20; Job 23:10; Psa 142:3; Zech 2:8; Isa 63:9**

# Evening

**I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day.**
 
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. -- He that watereth shall be watered.
 
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest: behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. -- The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season. -- Occupy till I come.
 
I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.  

**John 9:4; Prov 13:4; Prov 11:25; John 4:34-36; Matt 20:1,2; 2 Tim 4:2; Luke 19:13; 1 Cor 15:10**
