# Morning

**Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.**
 
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.
 
Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
 
What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? -- Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. The world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
 
In time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. -- Ye have not so learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, ... as the truth is in Jesus.  

**Rom 12:2; Exo 23:2; Jas 4:4; 2 Cor 6:14-16; 1 John 2:15,17; Eph 2:2; Eph 4:20,21**

# Evening

**Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.**
 
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground. -- We commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. -- Study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands.
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- The night cometh when no man can work.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Always abounding in the work of the Lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
 
There remaineth ... a rest to the people of God. -- Unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. -- This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing.  

**Psa 104:23; Gen 3:19; 2 Thes 3:10; 1 Thes 4:11; Eccl 9:10; John 9:4; Gal 6:9; 1 Cor 15:58; Heb 4:9; Matt 20:12; Isa 28:12**
