# Morning

**Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.**
 
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
 
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
 
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul: discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee.
 
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. -- I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. -- If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  

**John 17:17; John 15:3; Col 3:16; Psa 119:9,10; Prov 2:10,11; Job 23:11,12; Psa 119:99; John 8:31,32**

# Evening

**Fellow citizens with the saints.**
 
Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.
 
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. -- Our conversation (Gr. citizenship) is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. -- The Father, ... hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.
 
As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.  

**Eph 2:19; Heb 12:22,23; Heb 11:13; Phl 3:20,21; Col 1:12,13; 1 Pet 211**
