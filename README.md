# Morning

**The Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.**
 
Truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is a heavenly. Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. -- The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. -- No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
 
God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. -- Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
 
He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.  

**Deut 17:16; Heb 11:15,16,25,26; Heb 10:38,39; Luke 9:62; Gal 6:14; 2 Cor 6:17; Phl 1:6**

# Evening

**They talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.**
 
I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
 
He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. -- Comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
 
Let us not ... judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. -- We ... that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.
 
Charity ... rejoiceth not in iniquity. -- Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.  

**Psa 69:26; Zech 1:15; Gal 6:1; Jas 5:20; 1 Thes 5:14; Rom 14:30; Rom 15:1; 1 Cor 13:4,6; 1 Cor 10:12**
