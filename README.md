# Morning

**Let us go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.**
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- As ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
 
They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. -- Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  

**Heb 13:13,14; 1 Pet 4:12,13; 2 Cor 1:7; 1 Pet 4:14; Acts 5:41; Heb 11:25,26**

# Evening

**The Lord Jesus Christ ... shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.**
 
Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.
 
We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
 
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more. -- They sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.  

**Phl 3:20,21; Ezek 1:26; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:2; Rev 7:16; Rev 15:3**
