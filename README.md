# Morning

**Thou art my portion, O Lord.**
 
All things are yours; ... and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ ... gave himself for us. -- God gave him to be the head over all things to the church. -- Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
 
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. -- I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. -- O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord. The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintamest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.  

**Psa 119:57; 1 Cor 3:21,23; Tit 2:13,14; Eph 1:22; Eph 5:25,27; Psa 34:2; Isa 61:10; Psa 73:25,26; Psa 16:2,5,6**

# Evening

**There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.**
 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.
 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
 
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.  

**Prov 14:12; Psa 28:26; Psa 119:105; Psa 17:4; Deut 13:1-4; Psa 32:8**
