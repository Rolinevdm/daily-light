# Morning

**Consider how great things He hath done for you.**
 
Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.
 
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. -- The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. -- He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  

**1 Sam 12:24; Deut 8:2,5; Psa 119:75,71,67; Psa 118:18; Psa 103:10,11,14**

# Evening

**That blessed hope, ... the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.**
 
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil: whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus. -- Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things. -- When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.
 
The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, ... groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
 
Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
