# Morning

**In everything ye are enriched by him.**
 
When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall be not with him also freely give us all things?
 
In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.
 
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine ye are the branches: he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. -- Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
 
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.  

**1 Cor 1:5; Rom 5:6; Rom 8:32; Col 2:9,10; John 15:4,5; Rom 7:18; Eph 4:7; John 15:7; Col 3:16**

# Evening

**They shall see his face.**
 
I beseech thee shew me thy glory. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
 
Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. -- I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh.
 
I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. -- I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- The Lord himself shall descend from heaven ... the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
