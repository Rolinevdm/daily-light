# Morning

**His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.**
 
Underneath are the everlasting arms. -- When [Peter] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? -- The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
 
The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. -- Casting all your care upon Him, for he careth tor you. -- He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.
 
They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all.  

**Song 2:6; Deut 33:27; Matt 14:30,31; Psa 37:23,24; Deut 33:12; 1 Pet 5:7; Zech 2:8; John 10:28,29**

# Evening

**Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?**
 
The church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
 
Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
 
There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun. -- The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.
 
The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.  

**Song 6:10; Acts 20:28; Eph 5:25â€‘27; Rev 12:1; Rev 19:7,8; Rom 3:22; John 17:22**
