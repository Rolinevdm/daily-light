# Morning

**The Lord pondereth the hearts.**
 
The LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. -- The LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy. -- Thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. -- There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.
 
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. -- When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. -- He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  

**Prov 21:2; Psa 1:6; Num 16:5; Matt 6:4; Psa 139:23,24; 1 John 4:18; Psa 38:9; Psa 142:3; Rom 8:27; 2 Tim 2:19**

# Evening

**Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.**
 
No man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation. -- In me ye ... have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
 
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- The night is far spent, the day is at hand. -- He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
 
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces. -- There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. -- We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  

**Psa 30:5; 1 Thes 3:3,4; John 16:33; Psa 17:15; Rom 13:12; 2 Sam 23:4; Isa 25:8; Rev 21:4; 1 Thes 4:17,18**
