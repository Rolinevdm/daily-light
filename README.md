# Morning

**Thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.**
 
I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
 
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us. Help us, O God of our salvaton, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. -- Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. -- We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
 
If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.  

**John 4:2; Num 14:7,18; Psa 79:8,9; Jer 14:7; Jer 14:20; Psa 130:3,4**

# Evening

**Sanctification of the Spirit.**
 
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
 
Behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! -- Fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth: proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
 
The Comforter is the Holy Ghost. -- The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.
 
In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
 
All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
