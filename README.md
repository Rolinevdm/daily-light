# Morning

**I know that my Redeemer liveth.**
 
If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. -- This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
 
Because I live, ye shall live also. -- If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
 
The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. -- We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. -- Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.  

**Job 19:25; Rom 5:10; Heb 7:24,25; John 14:19; 1 Cor 15:19,20; Isa 59:20; Eph 1:7; 1 Pet 1:15,19**

# Evening

**The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.**
 
Take heed therefore how ye hear. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. -- Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
 
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
 
Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. -- But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.  

**1 Tim 4:1; Luke 8:18; Col 3:16; Eph 6:16; Psa 119:165,103,104; Psa 119:105; Psa 119:99; 2 Cor 11:14; Gal 1:8**
