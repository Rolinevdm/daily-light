# Morning

**Let us labour to enter into that rest.**
 
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction: ... strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. -- The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. -- Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you. -- Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: ... for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. -- So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
 
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. -- The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.  

**Heb 4:11; Matt 7:13,14; Matt 11:12; John 6:27; 2 Pet 1:10,11; 1 Cor 9:24,25; Heb 4:10; Isa 60:19**

# Evening

**Thou hearest me always.**
 
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. -- Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. -- Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. -- Not my will, but thine, be done.
 
As he is, so are we in this world. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.
 
Whatsoever we ask. we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
 
Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
 
He ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.  

**John 11:42; John 11:41; John 1228; Heb 10:7; Luke 22:42; 1 John 4:17; 1 John 5:14; 1 John 3:22; Heb 11:6; Heb 7:25; 1 John 2:1**
