# Morning

**He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.**
 
He knoweth our frame. -- He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.
 
He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. -- I ... will refine them as silver is refined, ... they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, the LORD is my God.  

**Job 23:10; Psa 103:14; Lam 3:33; 2 Tim 2:19-21; Mal 3:3; Zech 13:9**

# Evening

**Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.**
 
Moses said unto the LORD, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee. And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. -- He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
 
The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way. What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. -- Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
 
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. -- I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  

**Psa 25:4; Exo 33:12-14; Psa 103:7; Psa 25:9,12; Prov 3:5,6; Psa 16:11; Psa 32:8; Prov 4:18**
