# Morning

**Never man spake like this man.**
 
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. -- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. -- His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.
 
All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. -- He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. -- The sword of the Spirit ... is the word of God. -- The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoâ€‘edged sword. -- The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.  

**John 7:46; Psa 45:2; Isa 50:4; Song 5:16; Luke 4:22; Matt 7:29; Col 3:16; Eph 6:17; Heb 4:12; 2 Cor 10:4,5**

# Evening

**The triumphing of the wicked is short.**
 
Thou shalt bruise his heel. -- This is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- As the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. -- Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
 
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith. -- Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
 
The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. -- The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. -- The devil ... was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone ... and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  

**Job 20:5; Gen 3:15; Luke 22:53; Heb 2:14; Col 2:15; 1 Pet 5:8,9; Jas 4:7; Psa 37:12,13; Rom 16:20; Rev 20:10**
