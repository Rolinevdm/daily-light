# Morning

**The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those which are revealed belong unto us.**
 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
 
The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he will shew them his covenant. -- There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets. -- Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?
 
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. -- If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth.  

**Deut 29:29; Psa 131:1,2; Psa 25:14; Dan 2:28; Job 26:14; John 15:15; John 14:15-17**

# Evening

**The Spirit ... maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God**.
 
Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.
 
This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us; and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. -- This is the will of God, even your sanctification.
 
God hath ... called us ... unto holiness: ... who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
 
Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit.  

**Rom 8:27; John 16:23,24; Eph 6:18; 1 John 5:14,15; 1 Thes 4:3; 1 Thes 4:7,8; 1 Thes 5:16-19**
