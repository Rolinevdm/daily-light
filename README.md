# Morning

**Who can say, I have made my heart clean?**
 
The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. -- They that are in the flesh cannot please God.
 
To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. -- We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags: and we all do fade as a leaf: and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
 
The scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. -- God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  

**Prov 20:9; Psa 14:2,3; Rom 8:8; Rom 7:18,19; Isa 64:6; Gal 3:22; 2 Cor 5:19; 1 John 1:8,9**

**The floods lift up their waves.**
 
The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. -- O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
 
Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
 
Peter ... walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.  

**Psa 93:3; Psa 93:4; Psa 89:8,9; Jer 5:22; Isa 43:2; Matt 14:29; Psa 56:3**
