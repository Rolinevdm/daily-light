# Morning

**None of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.**
 
Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. -- Let no man seek his own: but every man another's wealth. -- Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
 
Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.
 
I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  

**Rom 14:7; Rom 14:8; 1 Cor 10:24; 1 Cor 6:20; Phl 1:20-23; Gal 2:19,20**

# Evening

**God gave Solomon ... largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.**
 
Behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- The Prince of Peace.
 
Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- The love of Christ passeth knowledge.
 
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. -- In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. -- The unsearchable riches of Christ. -- Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.  

**1 Kgs 4:29; Matt 12:42; Isa 9:6; Rom 5:7,8; Phl 2:6-8; Eph 3:19; 1 Cor 1:24; Col 2:3; Eph 3:8; 1 Cor 1:33**
