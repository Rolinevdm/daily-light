# Morning

**They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord harkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.**
 
It came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. -- Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst ot them. -- My fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. -- Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
 
Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. -- Behold, it is written before me.  

**Mal 3:16; Luke 24:15; Matt 18:20; Phl 4:3; Col 3:16; Heb 3:13; Matt 12:36,37; Isa 65:6**

# Evening

**The trees of the Lord are full of sap.**
 
I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shalt be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. -- Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
 
I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing.  

**Psa 104:16; Hos 14:5,6; Jer 17:7,8; Eze 17:24; Psa 92:12**
