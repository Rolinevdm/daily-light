# Morning

**The Lord will not cast off for ever: but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion.**
 
Fear thou not, ... saith the LORD: for I am with thee; I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure. -- For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee. O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
 
I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.  

**Lam 3:31,32; Jer 46:28; Isa 54:7,8,10,11; Mic 7:9**

# Evening

**God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.**
 
When the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud, ... a man lefthanded. After him was Shamgar, ... which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
 
The LORD looked upon [Gideon], and said, Go in this thy might: ... have not I sent thee? And he said unto him, O my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
 
The LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me, ... lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
 
Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. -- My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  

**1 Cor 1:27; Judg 3:15,31; Judg 7:2; Zech 4:6; Eph 6:10**
