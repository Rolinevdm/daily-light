# Morning

**Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.**
 
If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. -- Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. -- Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness.
 
Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. -- Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.  

**Heb 12:1,2; Luke 9:23; Luke 14:33; Rom 13:12; 1 Cor 9:25,27; Phl 3:13,14; Hos 6:3**

# Evening

**It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.**
 
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
 
We have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected us; and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
 
Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. -- Humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.  

**Lam 3:27; Prov 22:6; Heb 12:9,10; Psa 119:67,71; Jer 29:11; 1 Pet 5:6**
