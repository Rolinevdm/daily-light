# Morning

**The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.**
 
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own under-standing. -- If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbradeth not; and it shall be given him. -- The fool-ishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. -- God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. That no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. -- Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.
 
All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. -- Never man spake like this man. -- Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanc-tification, and redemption.  

**Prov 2:6; Prov 3:5; Jas 1:5; 1 Cor 1:25; 1 Cor 1:27,29; Psa 119:130; Psa 119:11; Luke 4:22; John 7:46; 1 Cor 1:30**

# Evening

**The year of my redeemed is come.**
 
Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, ... and unto his family.
 
Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead.
 
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
 
I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.
 
Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name.  

**Isa 63:4; Lev 25:10; Isa 26:19; 1 Thes 4:16,17; Hos 13:14; Jer 50:34**
