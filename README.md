# Morning

**Now he is comforted.**
 
Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. -- He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth. -- These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters. -- God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  

**Luke 16:25; Isa 60:20; Isa 25:8; Rev 7:14-17; Rev 21:4**

# Evening

**The night cometh when no man can work.**
 
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, ... they ... rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. -- There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. -- Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.
 
I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.
 
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.  

**John 9:4; Rev 14:13; Job 3:17; 1 Sam 28:15; Eccl 9:10; Psa 115:17; 2 Tim 4:6-8; Heb 4:9,10**
