# Morning

**My Father is greater than I.**
 
When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven. -- My Father, and your Father; ... my God and your God. As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. -- The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
 
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. -- Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
 
Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? -- I and my Father are one. -- As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's cornmandments, and abide in his love.

# Evening

**[The woman's seed] shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.**
 
His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
This is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.
 
The Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. -- He cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
 
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. -- In my name shall they cast out devils.
 
The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
