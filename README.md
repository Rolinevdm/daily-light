# Morning

**Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.**
 
It shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. -- I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. -- I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. -- Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.  

**John 6:37; Exo 22:27; Lev 26:44; Ezek 16:60; Isa 1:18; Isa 55:7; Luke 23:42,43; Isa 42:3**

# Evening

**His dear Son.**
 
Lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth. -- The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.
 
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love.
 
The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.  

**Col 1:13; Matt 3:17; Isa 42:1; John 1:18; 1 John 4:9,10,16; John 17:22-24; 1 John 3:1**
