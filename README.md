# Morning

**Oh that thou wouldest keep me from evil.**
 
Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. -- The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
 
Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
 
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. -- I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible. -- He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
 
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. -- The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.  

**1 Chr 4:10; Luke 22:46; Matt 26:41; Prov 30:7-9; Psa 121:7; Jer 15:21; 1 John 5:18; Rev 3:10; 2 Pet 2:9**

# Evening

**One star differeth from another star in glory.**
 
By the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all. -- Be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.
 
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.
 
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righeousness as the stars for ever and ever.  

**1 Cor 15:41; Mark 9:34,35; 1 Pet 5:5,6; Phl 2:5-7,9,10; Dan 12:3**
