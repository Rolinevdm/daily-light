# Morning

**The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.**
 
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. -- David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. -- God will surelv visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. -- I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt. and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. -- There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel: all came to pass.
 
He is faithful that promised. -- Hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? -- Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away -- The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.  

**Gen 21:1; Psa 62:8; 1 Sam 30: 6; Gen 50:24; Acts 7:34,36; Josh 21:45; Heb 10:23; Num 23:19; Matt 24:35; Isa 40:8**

# Evening

**The eyes of all wait upon thee.**
 
He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things. -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. -- Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.
 
The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. -- Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God.
 
The Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him. -- And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. -- If we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  

**Psa 145:15; Acts 17:25; Psa 145:9; Matt 6:26; Rom 10:12; Psa 121:1; Psa 123:2; Isa 30:18; Isa 25:9; Rom 8:25**
