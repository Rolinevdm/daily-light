# Morning

**My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.**
 
Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all ... things shall be added unto you. -- He that spared not his Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things? -- All things are your's: whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come: all are your's: and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. -- The Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will be withheld from them that walk uprightly. -- The living God, ... giveth us richly all things to enjoy. -- God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.  

**Phil 4:19; Matt 6:33; Rom 8:32; 1 Cor 3:21â€‘23; 2 Cor 6:10; Psa 23:1; Psa 84:11; 1 Tim 6:17; 2 Cor 9:8**

# Evening

**What communion hath light with darkness?**
 
Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. -- Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
Darkness hath blinded his eyes. -- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
 
The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. -- Love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
 
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.  

**2 Cor 6:14; John 3:19; 1 Thes 5:5; 1 John 2:11; Psa 119:105; Psa 74:20; 1 John 4:7,8; Prov 4:19,18; John 12:46; Eph 5:8**
