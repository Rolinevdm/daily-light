# Morning

**Be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.**
 
Ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. -- As ye have ... received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. -- He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- That on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
 
By faith ye stand.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
 
He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.  

**1 Cor 15:58; 1 Cor 15:58; Col 2:6,7; Matt 24:13; Luke 8:15; 2 Cor 1:24; John 9:4; Gal 6:8-10**

# Evening

**He is able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.**
 
I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Is any thing too hard for the LORD!
 
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.  

**Heb 7:25; John 14:6; Acts 4:12; John 10:27,28; Phl 1:6; Gen 18:14; Jude 24,25**
