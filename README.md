# Morning

**Awake to righteousness, and sin not.**
 
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
 
It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. -- Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed: and make you a new heart and a new spirit. -- Lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. -- Little children, abide in him that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.  

**1 Cor 15:34; 1 Thes 5:5,6; Rom 13:11,12; Eph 6:13; Ezek 18:31; Jas 1:21; 1 John 2:28,29**

# Evening

**My sheep hear my voice.**
 
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
 
I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
 
Speak; for thy servant heareth. -- When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. -- I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.  

**John 10:27; Rev 3:20; Song 5:2,6; 1 Sam 3:10; Luke 19:5,6; Psa 85:8**
