# Morning

**Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.**
 
Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! -- Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. -- I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
 
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. -- Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
 
Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do.  

**Lam 3:41; Psa 113:5,6; Psa 25:1; Psa 143:6-8; Psa 63:3,4; Psa 86:4,5; John 14:13**

# Evening

**Watchman, what of the night?**
 
It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
 
Learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
 
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
 
Watch, ... for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.  

**Isa 21:11; Rom 13:11,12; Matt 24:32,33,35; Psa 130:5,6; Rev 22:20; Matt 25:13**
