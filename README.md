# Morning

**Whom having not seen, ye love.**
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. -- In whom ye trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. -- God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
 
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. -- Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.  

**1 Pet 1:8; 2 Cor 5:7,1 John 4:19,1 John 4:16; Eph L:13; Col 1:27; 1 John 4:20; John 20:29; Psa 2:12**

# Evening

**The Lord Our Righteousness.**
 
We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.
 
I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. -- I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him. -- To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord ... that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.  

**Jer 23:6; Isa 64:6; Psa 71:16; Isa 61:10; Luke 15:22; Rev 19:8; Phl 3:8,9**
