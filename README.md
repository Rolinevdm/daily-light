# Morning

**Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase.**
 
He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. -- Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.
 
God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister.
 
I beseech you ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable ser-vice. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves. but unto him which died for them, and rose again. -- Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  

**Prov 3:9; 2 Cor 9:6; 1 Cor 16:2; Heb 6:10; Rom 12:l; 2 Cor 5:14,15; 1 Cor 10:31**

# Evening

**There shall be no night there.**
 
The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
 
The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. -- They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.
 
Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. -- Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. -- Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.
 
We are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  

**Rev 21:25; Isa 60:19; Rev 21:24; Rev 22:5; 1 Pet 2:9; Col 1:12,13; Eph 5:8; 1 Thes 5:5; Prov 4:18**
