# Morning

**In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.**
 
My beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. -- He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. -- If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body. -- By thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. -- Set a watch, Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
 
Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but com-mitted himself to him that judgeth righteously. -- Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
 
In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.  

**Prov 10:19; Jas 1:19; Prov 16:32; Jas 3:2; Matt 12:37; Psa 141:3; 1 Pet 2:21‑23; Heb 12:3; Rev 14:5**

# Evening

**Teach me thy way, O Lord.**
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
 
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
 
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Having ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.
 
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord. -- All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.  

**Psa 27:11; Psa 32:8; Psa 25:8,9; John 10:9; John 14:6; Heb 10:19‑22; Hos 6:3; Psa 25:10**
