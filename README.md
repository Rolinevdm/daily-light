# Morning

**His mercy is on them that fear Him.**
 
Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
 
If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. -- The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
 
Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, ... and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord. -- To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. -- The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  

**Luke 1:50; Psa 31:19,20; 1 Pet 1:17; Psa 145:18,19; 2 Kgs 22:19; Isa 66:2; Psa 34:18**

# Evening

**Them that honour me I will honour.**
 
Whosoever ... shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. -- He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
 
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
 
Fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
 
Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. -- Praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.  

**1 Sam 2:30; Matt 10:32; Matt 10:37â€‘39; Jas 1:12; Rev 2:10; 2 Cor 4:17; 1 Pet 1:7**
