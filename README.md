# Morning

**God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent.**
 
The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turn-ing. -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.
 
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the im-mutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.
 
The faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations. -- All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testi-monies. -- Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God ... which keepeth truth for ever.  

**Num 23:19; Jas 1:17; Heb 13:8; Psa 91:4; Heb 6:17,18; Deut 7:9; Psa 25:10; Psa 146:5,6**

# Evening

**If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.**
 
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. -- My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. -- He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee.
 
I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
 
Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things per-taining to God, ... who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way: so also Christ, ... though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. -- Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.  

**Prov 24:10; Isa 40:29; 2 Cor 12:9; Psa 91:15; Deut 33:27; Psa 69:20; Heb 5:1,2,5,8,9; Isa 53:4**
