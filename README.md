# Morning

**Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.**
 
A just God and a Saviour.The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.
 
God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. -- Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forebearance of God; to declare I say at this time his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? It is God that justifieth. -- To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteousness.  

**Psa 85:10; Isa 45:21; Isa 42:21; 2 Cor 5:19; Rom 3:25,26; Isa 53:5; Rom 8:33; Rom 4:5**

# Evening

**How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?**
 
Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; ... it doth not appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of heavenly.
 
The Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; ... shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
 
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. -- He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.
 
If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  

**1 Cor 15:35; 1 John 3:2; 1 Cor 15:49; Phl 3:20,21; Luke 24:36,37; 1 Cor 15:5,6; Rom 8:11**
