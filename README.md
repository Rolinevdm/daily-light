# Morning

**We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.**
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
 
We love him, because he first loved us.
 
Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.  

**1 John 4:16; Eph 2:4‑7; John 3:16; Rom 8:32; Psa 145:9; 1 John 4:19; Luke 1:45**

# Evening

**Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.**
 
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
 
Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. -- Having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
 
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise: and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty.  

**Rom 12:16; Jas 2:1,5; 1 Cor 10:24; 1 Tim 6:8,9; 1 Cor 1:27‑29; Psa 131:1**
