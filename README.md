# Morning

**What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.**
 
My days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. -- Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep ... in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up: in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. -- Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.
 
The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. -- They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.  

**Jas 4:14; Job 9:25,26; Psa 90:5,6; Job 14:2; 1 John 2:17; Psa 102:26,27; Heb 13:8**

# Evening

**I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.**
 
Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
 
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.
 
I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.  

**1 Cor 14:15; Eph 5:18,19; Col 3:16; Psa 145:21; Psa 147:1,7; Rev 14:2**
