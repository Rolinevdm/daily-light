# Morning

**The fruit of the spirit is meekness.**
 
The meek ... shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. -- Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. -- The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ... is in the sight of God of great price. -- Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.
 
Follow after meekness. -- Take my yoke upon you and learn O me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. -- He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth. -- Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled reviled not again, ... but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.  

**Gal 5:22; Isa 29:19; Matt 8:3,4; 1 Cor 3:4; 1 Cor 13:4; 1 Tim 6:11; Matt 11:29; Isa 53:7; 1 Pet 2:21-23**

# Evening

**If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.**
 
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report. -- All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. -- The offence of the cross.
 
If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye: but let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
 
Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. -- If one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. -- If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.  

**Luke 9:23; 2 Cor 6:8; 2 Tim 3:12; Gal 5:11; Gal 1:10; 1 Pet 4:14-16; Phl 1:29; 2 Cor 5:14,15; 2 Tim 2:12**
