# Morning

**Who shall be able to stand?**
 
Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he ap-peareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap.
 
I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands. These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more: neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
 
There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. -- Stand fast therefore in the liberty where-with Christ hath made us free.  

**Rev 6:17; Mal 3:2; Rev 7:9,14-17; Rom 8:1; Gal 5:1**

# Evening

**Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.**
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
 
Let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me. -- Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.
 
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ. -- By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
 
By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  

**Psa 143:2; Isa 1:18; Isa 27:5; Job 22:21; Rom 5:1; Gal 2:16; Rom 3:20; Acts 13:39; 1 Cor 15:57**
