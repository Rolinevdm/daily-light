# Morning

**Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart.**
 
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. -- Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. -- Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
 
The trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. -- Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  

**Psa 27:14; Isa 40:28,29; Isa 41:10; Isa 25:4; Jas 1:3,4; Heb 10:35,36**

# Evening

**He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.**
 
The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. -- Rest in the LORD. -- He that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works.
 
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace. -- That ... we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.
 
I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.  

**Psa 23:2; Isa 57:20,21; Matt 11:28; Psa 37:7; Heb 4:10; Heb 13:9; Eph 4:14,15; Song 2:3,4**
