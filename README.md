# Morning

**Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.**
 
Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
 
I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. -- I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart. -- O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. -- If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. -- To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
 
Be not conformed to this world: but ye be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  

**Matt 6:10; Psa 103:20,21; John 6:38; Psa 40:8; Matt 26:42; Matt 7:21; Rom 2:13; John 13:17; Jas 4:17; Rom 12:2**

# Evening

**The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.**
 
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. -- Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. -- I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith. -- He that is spiritual judgeth all things.
 
Take heed what ye hear. -- I know thy works, ... and how thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars. -- Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
 
He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.  

**Job 34:3; 1 John 4:1; John 7:24; 1 Cor 10:15; Col 3:16; Rev 2:29; 1 Cor 2:15; Mark 4:24; Rev 2:2; 1 Thes 5:21; John 10:3â€‘5**
