# Morning

**Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.**
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 
Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? ... If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
 
Unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.  

**Matt 28:20; Mark 18:19,20; John 14:21; John 14:22,23; Jude 24,25**

# Evening

**The end of all things is at hand.**
 
I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. -- The heavens and the earth, which are now, ... are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment.
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. -- Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.
 
We have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- We ... look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.  

**1 Pet 4:7; Rev 20:11; 2 Pet 3:7; Psa 46:1-3; Matt 24:6; 2 Cor 5:1; 2 Pet 3:13,14**
