# Morning

**When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.**
 
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. -- I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.
 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. -- What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. -- The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  

**Mic 7:8; Isa 43:2,3; Isa 42:16; Psa 23:4; Psa 56:3,4; Psa 27:1**

# Evening

**One God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.**
 
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD. -- A mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
 
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies ... Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
 
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
 
He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.  

**1 Tim 2:5; Deut 6:4; Gal 3:20; Psa 106:6,7,23; Heb 3:1-3; Heb 8:6,12**
