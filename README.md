# Morning

**When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.**
 
Where is boasting then? It Is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. -- What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? -- By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
 
By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. -- For of him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things. -- All things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee.
 
Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.  

**Luke 17:10; Rom 3:27; 1 Cor 4:7; Eph 2:8-10; 1 Cor 15:10; Rom 11:36; 1 Chr 29:14; Psa 143:2**

# Evening

**He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.**
 
The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
 
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
 
Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? -- In him we live, and move, and have our being. -- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
 
He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.  

**Psa 103:14; Gen 2:7; Psa 139:14-16; Mal 2:10; Acts 17:28; Psa 103:13; Psa 78:38,39**
