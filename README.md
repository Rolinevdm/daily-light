# Morning

**The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.**
 
The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. -- Thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
 
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. -- I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
 
Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept.
 
The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

# Evening

**Jesus wept.**
 
A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. -- We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. -- It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. -- Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
 
I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
 
Behold how he loved. -- He took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. In all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  

**John 11:35; Isa 53:3; Heb 4:15; Heb 2:10; Heb 5:8; Isa 50:5,6; John 11:36; Heb 2:16,17**
