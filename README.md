# Morning

**Thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark, and there I will meet with thee.**
 
The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest. -- Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
 
Having ... brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; ... let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
 
Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation [mercy seat] through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. -- Through him we have access by one Spirit unto the Father.  

**Exo 25:21,22; Heb 9:8; Matt 27:50,51; Heb 10:19,20,22; Heb 4:16; Rom 3:24,25; Eph 2:18**

# Evening

**Faith as a grain of mustard seed.**
 
Barak said unto [Deborah], if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan. -- Gideon ... feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, ... did it by night. And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou hast said, ... let me prove, I pray thee. And God did so.
 
Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. -- Who hath despised the day of small things?
 
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly. -- Lord, increase our faith. -- I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.  

**Matt 17:20; Judg 4:8,23; Judg 6:27,36,39,40; Rev 3:8; Zech 4:10; 2 Thes 1:3; Luke 17:5; Hos 14:5,6**
