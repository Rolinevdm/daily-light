# Morning

**Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.**
 
He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. -- I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
Because I live, ye shall live also. -- I give unto them eternal life: and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.
 
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God ... For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  

**Rom 6:11; John 5:24; Gal 2:19,20; John 14:19; John 10:28‑30; Gal 3:1,3**

# Evening

**God ... giveth ... liberally, and upbraideth not.**
 
Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
 
The grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many ... The free gift is of many offences unto justification.
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  

**Jas 1:5; John 8:10,11; Rom 5:15,16; Eph 2:4‑7; Rom 8:32**
