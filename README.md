# Morning

**Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.**
 
Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
 
Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God. -- Priests of God and of Christ.
 
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus. -- By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. -- The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.  

**Exo 19:6; Rev 5:9,10; 1 Pet 2:9; Isa 61:6; Rev 20:6; Heb 3:1; Heb 13:15; Eph 2:10; 1 Cor 3:17**

# Evening

**We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them.**
 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. -- Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving. -- Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith.
 
Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? -- Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
 
Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
 
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  

**Neh 4:9; Matt 26:41; Col 4:2; 1 Pet 5:7-9; Luke 6:46; Jas 1:22; Exo 14:15; Phl 4:6,7**
