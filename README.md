# Morning

**I am black, but comely.**
 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. -- Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God. I am a sinful man, O Lord. -- Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair. I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. -- Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
 
When I would do good, evil is present with me. -- Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing -- Ye are complete in him. -- Perfect in Christ Jesus.
 
Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.  

**Song 1:5; Psa 51:5; Ezek 16:14; Luke 5:8; Song 4:1; Job 42:6; Song 4:7; Rom 7:21; Matt 9:2; Rom 7:18; Col 2:10; Col 1:28; 1 Cor 6:11; 1 Pet 2:9**

# Evening

**All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.**
 
I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother and the daughter‑in‑law against her mother‑in‑law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. -- Whosoever ... will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. -- Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
 
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. The servant is not greater than his lord. -- I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.  

**2 Tim 3:12; Matt 10:35,36; Jas 4:4; 1 John 2:15,16; John 15:18‑20; John 17:14**
