# Morning

**Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of.**
 
Ye have not, because ye ask not.
 
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. -- If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. -- Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. -- Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.
 
The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. The Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. -- Ye shall ask in my name; and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  

**Ezek 36:37; Jas 4:2; Matt 7:7,8; 1 John 5:14,15; Jas 1:5; Psa 81:10; Luke 18:1; Psa 34:15,17; John 16:26,27,24**

# Evening

**Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?**
 
I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. -- O Lord, thou art our father, we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. -- It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good. Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments.
 
He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. -- Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. -- It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. -- Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
 
Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
