# Morning

**Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect**.
 
I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. -- Ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.
 
Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's
 
Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power. -- Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity. -- Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
 
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. -- Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. -- Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.  

**Matt 5:48; Gen 17:1; Lev 20:26; 1 Cor 6:20; Col 2:10; Tit 2:14; 2 Pet 3:14; Psa 119:1; Jas 1:25; Psa 139:23,24**

**Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.**
 
Dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit.
 
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. -- Teaching us that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -- Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.
 
Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
 
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. -- For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledege of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.  

**2 Cor 7:1; 2 Cor 7:1; Psa 51:6; Tit 2:12; Matt 5:16; Phl 3:12; 1 John 3:3; 2 Cor 5:5; Eph 4:12,13**
