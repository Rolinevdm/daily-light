# Morning

**I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.**
 
Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.
 
O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt. -- According to your faith be it unto you. -- Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
 
They drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and [Jesus] made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: ... he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? -- I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight. -- My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

# Evening

**Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.**
 
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. -- Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord, the first, and with the last: I am he.
 
Sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ. -- The very God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? -- The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me.
 
It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
