# Morning

**Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.**
 
Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
 
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; ... we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
 
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  

**1 Thes 5:8; 1 Pet 1:13; Eph 6:14,16,17; Isa 25:8,9; Heb 11:1**

# Evening

**The children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.**
 
Thus saith the LORD, because the Syrians have said, the LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD. And they pitched one over against the other seven days; and so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. -- Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
 
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
 
They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.  

**1 Kgs 20:27; 1 Kgs 20:28,29; 1 John 4:4; Isa 41:10; Jer 1:19**
