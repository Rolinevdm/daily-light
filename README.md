# Morning

**He ever liveth to make intercession.**
 
Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that died ... who also maketh intercession for us. -- Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.
 
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
 
Seeing ... that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. -- Through him we ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

# Evening

**They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.**
 
This is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor. -- O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
 
The mighty God, The everlasting Father. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
The Prince of Peace. -- He is our peace. -- Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. -- Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help. -- As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.
