# Morning

**Thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord.**
 
Jesus ... because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory.
 
Seeing ... that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.
 
The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him: and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.  

**Exo 28:12; Heb 7:24,25; Jude 24; Heb 4:14â€‘16; Deut 33:12**

# Evening

**On that night could not the king sleep.**
 
Thou holdest mine eyes waking. -- Who is like unto the Lord our God, ... who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
 
He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. -- Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. -- Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
 
The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. -- We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.
 
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  

**Esth 6:1; Psa 77:4; Psa 113:5,6; Dan 4:35; Psa 77:19; Psa 76:10; 2 Chr 16:9; Rom 8:28; Matt 10:29,30**
