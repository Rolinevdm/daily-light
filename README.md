# Morning

**The fruit of the Spirit is joy.**
 
Joy in the Holy Ghost. -- Unspeakable and full of glory. Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; ... exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. -- We glory in tribulations.
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; ... for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame. -- These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be fuIl. -- As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. -- The joy of the Lord is your strength. In thy presence is fulness of joy: at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. -- For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.  

**Gal 5:22; Rom 14:17; 1 Pet 1:8; 2 Cor 6:10; 7,4; Rom 5:3; Heb 122; John 15:11; 2 Cor 1:5; Phl 4:4; Neh 8:10; Psa 16:11; Rev 7:17**

# Evening

**Jehovahâ€‘shalom: (The Lord send peace.)**
 
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
 
Behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. -- My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places; when it shall hail, coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place.
 
He is our peace. -- This man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.
