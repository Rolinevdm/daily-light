## Morning

**Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.**
 
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. -- My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
 
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. -- Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord, Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
 
Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house that I have builded? -- Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. -- Ye are the temple of living God.  

**Gen 28:16; Matt 18:20; Matt 28:20; Exo 33:14; Psa 139:7,8; Jer 23:23,24; 1 Kgs 8:27; Isa 57:15; 2 Cor 6:16**

## Evening

**Keep yourselves from idols.**
 
My son, give me thine heart. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
 
Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them? -- Mortify ... your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry. -- They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things.
 
If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. -- My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
 
Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- The Lord looketh on the heart.  

**1 John 5:21; Prov 23:26; Gal 3:2; Ezek 14:3; Gal 3:5; 1 Tim 6:9-11; Psa 62:10; Prov 8:19; Matt 6:21; 1 Sam 16:7**
