# Morning

**Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.**
 
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power. -- As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. -- Trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. -- Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
 
I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
 
Fight the good fight of faith. -- In nothing terrified by your adversaries.  

**2 Tim 21; Col 1:11; Col 2:6,7; Isa 61:3; Eph 2:20,22; Acts 20:32; Phl 1:11; 1 Tim 6:12; Phl 1:28**

# Evening

**Thou renderest to every man according to his work.**
 
Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. -- We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
 
When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. -- After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God. -- LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.  

**Psa 62:12; 1 Cor 3:11,14,15; 2 Cor 5:10; Matt 6:3,4; Matt 25:19; 2 Cor 3:5; Isa 26:12**
