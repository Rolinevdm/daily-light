# Morning

**My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.**
 
Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. -- Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. -- In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
 
He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- Our sufficiency is of God.
 
Lead us not into temptation. -- O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. -- My times are in thy hand.  

**Exo 33:14; Deut 31:6,8; Josh 1:9; Prov 3:6; Heb 13:5,6; 2 Cor 3:5; Matt 6:13; Jer 10:23; Psa 31:15**

# Evening

**Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.**
 
How forcible are right words! -- I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.
 
They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. -- If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
 
The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone. -- Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
 
Let ... no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. -- Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.  

**Heb 10:24; Job 6:25; 2 Pet 3:1; Mal 3:16; Matt 18:19; Gen 2:18; Eccl 4:9,10; Rom 14:13; Gal 6:2,1**
