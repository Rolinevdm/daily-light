# Morning

**Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.**
 
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, ... so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall acomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
 
God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  

**2 Pet 3:8,9; Isa 55:8â€‘11; Rom 11:32,33**

# Evening

**Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning.**
 
The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? -- We had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us. -- The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
 
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. -- Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.
 
Be instant in season, out of season. -- Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.
 
Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. -- Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.  

**Amos 4:11; Isa 33:14; 2 Cor 1:9,10; Rom 6:23; Heb 10:31; 2 Cor 5:11; 2 Tim 4:2; Jude 23; Zech 4:6; 1 Tim 2:4**
