# Morning

**The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.**
 
Your lamb shall be without blemish, ... and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it, ... and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. -- The blood of sprinkling. -- Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. -- Being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. -- According to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.
 
We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins. Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.  

**Rev 13:8; Exo 12:5â€‘7,13; Heb 12:24; 1 Cor 5:7; Acts 2:23; 2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:7; 1 Pet 4:1,2**

# Evening

**I have trodden the winepress alone.**
 
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree. -- Being made a curse for us.
 
O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. -- Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. -- He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
 
O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. -- They overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.  

**Isa 63:3; Exo 15:11; Isa 59:16; 1 Pet 2:24; Gal 3:13; Psa 98:1; Col 2:15; Isa 53:11; Judg 5:21; Rom 8:37; Rev 12:11**
