# Morning

**As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.**
 
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. -- Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. -- He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. -- I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
 
He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. -- He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  

**Rev 3:19; Heb 12:5,6; Prov 3:12; Job 5:18; 1 Pet 5:6; Isa 48:10; Lam 3:33; Psa 103:10-14**

# Evening

**God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.**
 
When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
 
They ... called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.
 
Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other.
 
Lord, teach us to pray.  

**Eccl 5:2; Matt 6:7,8; 1 Kgs 18:26; Luke 18:10,11,13,14; Luke 11:1**
