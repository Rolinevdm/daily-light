# Morning

**I, even I, am he that comforteth you.**
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. -- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you. -- Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.
 
Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
 
Another Comforter ... even the Spirit of truth. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities.
 
God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  

**Isa 51:12; 2 Cor 1:3,4; Psa 103:3,14; Isa 66:13; 1 Pet 5:7; Psa 86:15; John 14:16,17; Rom 8:26; Rev 21:4**

# Evening

**Ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son**.
 
He received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
 
The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame. -- These things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. -- As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.  

**1 Cor 1:9; 2 Pet 1:17; 1 John 3:1; Eph 5:1; Rom 8:17; Heb 1:3; Matt 5:16; Heb 12:2; John 17:13; 2 Cor 1:5**
