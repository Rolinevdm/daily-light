# Morning

**Understanding what the will of the Lord is.**
 
This is the will of God, even your sanctification. -- Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. -- This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. -- We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
 
We ... do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. -- The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, ... give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your under-standing being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe.  

**Eph 5:17; 1 Thes 4:3; Job 22:21; John 17:3; 1 John 5:20; Col 1:9; Eph 1:17-19**

# Evening

**Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.**
 
Enoch walked with God. -- Can two walk together, except they be agreed? -- It is good for me to draw near to God.
 
The LORD is with you, while ye be with him: and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. When they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
 
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
 
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, ... and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.  

**James 4:8; Gen 5:24; Amos 3:3; Psa 73:28; 2 Chr 15:2,4; Jer 29:11-13; Heb 10:19-22**
