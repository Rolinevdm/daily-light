# Morning

**He shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.**
 
Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree.
 
He hath made us accepted in the Beloved. As lively stones, ... built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. -- I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
 
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.  

**Lev 1:4; 1 Pet 1:18,19; 1 Pet 2:24; Eph 1:6; 1 Pet 2:5; Rom 12:1; Jude 24,25**

# Evening

**In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.**
 
When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (the lust of the flesh), and that it was pleasant to the eyes (the lust of the eyes), and a tree to be desired to make one wise (the pride of life), she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 
When the tempter came to [Jesus], he said, if thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread (the lust of the flesh). But he answered, ... Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The devil ... sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them (the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life). Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan.
 
In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
 
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.  

**Heb 4:15; Gen 3:6; 1 John 2:16; Matt 4:3,4,8â€‘10; 1 John 2:16; Heb 2:18; Jas 1:12**
