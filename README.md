# Morning

**To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.**
 
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? -- Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. -- To love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
 
Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. -- Mary ... sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. One thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
 
It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.  

**Prov 21:3; Mic 6:8; 1 Sam 15:22; Matt 12:33; Hos 12:6; Luke 10:39,42; Phl 2:13**

# Evening

**The spirit shall return unto God who gave it.**
 
The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. -- There is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. -- The first man Adam was made a living soul. -- The spirit of man that goeth upward.
 
Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are confident, ... and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. -- With Christ; which is far better. -- I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
 
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  

**Eccl 12:7; Gen 2:7; Job 32:8; 1 Cor 15:45; Eccl 3:21; 2 Cor 5:6,8; Phl 1:23; 1 Thes 4:13,14; John 14:2,3**
