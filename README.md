# Morning

**Take thou also unto thee principal spices, and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment.**
 
Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. -- One Spirit. -- Diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
 
Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. -- God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. -- God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
 
Of his fulness have all we received. -- As the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. -- He which ... hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  

**Exo 30:23,25; Exo 30:32; Eph 4:4; 1 Cor 12:4; Psa 45:7; Acts 10:38; John 3:34; John 1:16; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor 1:21,22; Gal 5:22,23**

# Evening

**The fashion of this world passeth away.**
 
All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
 
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. -- For what is your life? It is even a vapour of that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
 
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. -- When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.  

**1 Cor 7:31; Gen 5:27; Jas 1:9-11; Jas 4:14; 1 John 2:17; Psa 39:4; 1 Thes 5:3,4**
