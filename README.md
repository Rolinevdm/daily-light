# Morning

**Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.**
 
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. -- Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
 
Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may he able to stand against the wiles of the devil. -- And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. -- Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. -- Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. -- This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
 
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.  

**Jas 4:7; Isa 59:19; Matt 4:10,11; Eph 6:10,11; Eph 5:11; 2 Cor 2:11; 1 Pet 5:8,9; 1 John 5:4; Rom 8:33**

# Evening

**Oh that I knew where I might find him!**
 
Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.
 
Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. -- Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
 
Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
 
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
 
Look, I am with you alway. -- I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. -- The Comforter ... dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.  

**Job 23:3; Isa 50:10; Jer 29:13; Luke 11:9,10; 1 John 1:3; Eph 2:13,18; 1 John 1:6; Matt 28:20; Heb 13:5; John 14:16,17**
