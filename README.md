# Morning

**As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.**
 
The fellowship of his sufferings. -- Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the im-mutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. -- Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.  

**2 Cor 1:5; Phl 3:10; 1 Pet 4:13; 2 Tim 2:11; Rom 8:17; Heb 6:17,18; 2 Thes 2:16,17**

# Evening

**Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.**
 
Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap. Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not. Seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
 
Having food and raiment let us be therewith content ... They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
 
The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
 
Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.  

**Luke 10:41; Luke 12:24,27,29,30; 1 Tim 6:8-10; Mark 4:19; Heb 12:1**
