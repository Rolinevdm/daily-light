# Morning

**The Lord was my stay.**
 
Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. -- The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. -- Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
 
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. -- So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
 
By the grace of God I am what I am.  

**Psa 18:8; Jer 3:23; Psa 18:2; Isa 12:6; Psa 34:7,17; Deut 33:27; Heb 13:6; Psa 18:31,32; 1 Cor 15:10**

# Evening

**All we like sheep have gone astray.**
 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. -- There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable.
 
Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. -- I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteous for his name's sake.
 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, either shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
 
What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?  

**Isa 53:6; 1 John 1:8; Rom 3:10â€‘12; 1 Pet 2:25; Psa 119:176; Psa 23:3; John 10:27,28; Luke 15:4**
