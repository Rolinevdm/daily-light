# Morning

**The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.**
 
He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -- Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. -- Who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.  

**Rom 3:22; 2 Cor 5:21; Gal 3:13; 1 Cor 1:30; Tit 3:5,6; Phl 3:8,9**

# Evening

**The spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.**
 
Jesus ... lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, ... Holy Father, ... O righteous Father. -- He said, Abba, Father. -- Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. -- For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God.
 
Doubtless thou art our father, ... thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.
 
I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father.Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.
