# Morning

**Thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover.**
 
Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. -- There remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God.
 
Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediatety. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching. -- Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, ... I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded,  

**Exo 12:11; Mic 2:10; Heb 13:14; Heb 4:9; Luke 12:35‑37; 1 Pet 1:13; Phl 3:13‑15**

# Evening

**The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.**
 
Heirs of God, and joint‑heirs with Christ. -- All things are your’s. -- My beloved is mine. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
The Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.
 
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land.  

**Psa 16:5; Rom 8:17; 1 Cor 3:21; Song 2:16; Gal 2:20; Num 8:20; Psa 73:25,26; Psa 23:4; 2 Tim 1:12; Psa 63:1**
