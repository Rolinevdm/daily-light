# Morning

**The fruit ot the Spirit is goodness.**
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children. -- Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. -- Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
 
After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  

**Gal 5:22; Eph 5:1; Matt 5:44,45; Luke 6:36; Eph 5:9; Tit 3:4-6; Psa 145:9; Rom 8:32**

# Evening

**Ebenezer ... Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.**
 
I was brought low, and he helped me. -- Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
 
It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. -- Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God. -- He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. -- There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord hath spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
 
When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. -- Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.  

**1 Sam 7:12; Psa 116:6; Psa 28:6,7; Psa 118:8,9; Psa 146:5, -psa 107:7; Josh 21:45; Luke 22:35; Psa 63:7**
