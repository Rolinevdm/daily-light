# Morning

**The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.**
 
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
 
Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly. -- That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. -- In all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. -- Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. And take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. -- Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  

**Rev 12:10; Rev 12:11; Rom 8:33,34; Col 2:15; Heb 2:14,15; Rom 8:37; Eph 6:11,17; 1 Cor 15:57**

# Evening

**The tree of life**.
 
God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. -- He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.
 
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. -- In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
 
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom. Length of days is in her right hand. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. -- Christ Jesus, ... is made unto us wisdom.  

**Gen 2:9; 1 John 5:11; John 3:16; John 5:21,26; Rev 2:7; Rev 22:2; Prov 3:13,16,18; 1 Cor 1:30**
