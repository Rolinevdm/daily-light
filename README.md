# Morning

**The entrance of thy words giveth light.**
 
This ... is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. -- God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. -- The Word was God. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. -- If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
 
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. -- Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
 
Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.  

**Psa 119:130; 1 John 1:5; 2 Cor 4:6; John 1:1,4; 1 John 1:7; Psa 119:11; John 15:3; Eph 5:8; 1 Pet 2:9**

# Evening

**Noah was a just man.**
 
The just shall live by faith. -- Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour. -- The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
 
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference.
 
We ... joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect ? It is God that justifieth. -- Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified.
