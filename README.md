# Morning

**I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.**
 
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. -- We are all as an unclean thing. -- I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
 
As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. -- Ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. -- Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but ... the righteousness which is of God by faith.
 
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him. -- The fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.  

**Zech 3:4; Psa 32:1; Isa 64:6; Rom 7:18; Col 3:27; Col 3:9,10; Phl 3:9; Luke 15:22; Rev 19:8; Isa 61:10**

# Evening

**The day shall declare it.**
 
Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
 
Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more.
 
God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. -- The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
 
The Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name, great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.  

**1 Cor 3:13; 1 Cor 4:5; Rom 14:10,12,13; Rom 2:16; John 5:22,27; Jer 32:18,19**
