# Morning

**Walk in love.**
 
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. -- Above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. -- Love covereth all sins.
 
When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. -- Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again. -- Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth. -- Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrar-wise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. -- If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. -- Be ye kind one to another, tender‑hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
 
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  

**Eph 5:2; John 13:34; 1 Pet 4:8; Prov 10:12; Mark 11:25; Luke 6:35; Prov 24:17; 1 Pet 3:9; Rom 12:18; Eph 4:32; 1 John 3:18**

# Evening

**Let your requests be made known unto God.**
 
Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. -- There was given to me a thorn in the flesh. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.
 
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. -- Hannah ... was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and ... wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life. The Lord remembered her.
 
We know not what we should pray for as we ought. -- He shall choose our inheritance for us.
