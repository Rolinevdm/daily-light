# Morning

**The Lord is at hand.**
 
The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. -- He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
 
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
 
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.  

**Phl 4:5; 1 Thes 4:16; Rev 22:20; 2 Pet 3:14; 1 Thes 5:22; Jas 5:8**

# Evening

**The choice vine.**
 
My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, ... and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. -- Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me.
 
The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, ... envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: ... but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, good-ness, faith, meekness, temperance.
 
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purg-eth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Abide in me, and I in you ... Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.  

**Gen 49:11; Isa 5:1,2; Jer 2:21; Gal 5:19,21; John 15:1,2,4,8**
