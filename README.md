# Morning

**Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.**
 
It pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. -- Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? -- We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
 
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. -- Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God.  

**Rom 14:9; Isa 53:10,11; Luke 24:26; 2 Cor 5:14,15; Acts 2:36; 1 Pet 1:20,21**

# Evening

**Give us this day our daily bread.**
 
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. -- His bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. -- The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
 
He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, ... that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. -- Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  

**Matt 6:11; Psa 37:25; Isa 33:16; 1 Kgs 17:6; Phl 4:19; Heb 13:5; Deut 8:3; John 6:32-34**
