# Morning

**The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.**
 
I know that thou canst do every thing. -- The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. -- He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? -- There is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? -- Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee.
 
Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. -- Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. -- The mighty God. -- All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. -- Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed, ... there be more with us than with him.  

**Rev 19:6; Job 42:2; Luke 18:27; Dan 4:35; Isa 43:13; Mark 14:36; Matt 9:28,29; Matt 8:23; Isa 9:6; Matt 28:18; Psa 20:7; 2 Chr 32:7**

# Evening

**What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee?**
 
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? -- To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good.
 
As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for The just shall live by faith. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.
 
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.
 
Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.  

**1 Sam 3:17; Mic 6:8; Deut 10:13; Gal 3:10,11,19; Heb 1:1,2; 1 Sam 3:9**
