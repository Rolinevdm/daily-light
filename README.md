# Morning

**I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.**
 
Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that be might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. -- Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
 
The peace of God ... passeth all understanding. -- Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body.
 
Our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. -- Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

**1 Thes 5:23; Eph 5:25,27; Col 1:28; Phl 4:7; Col 3:15; 2 Thes 2:16,17; 1 Cor 1:8**

# Evening

**Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?**
 
Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. -- I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
 
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
 
Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. -- Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you. -- Ye ... are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
 
The heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.  

**2 Chr 6:18; Exo 25:8; Exo 29:43,45; Psa 68:18; 2 Cor 6:16; 1 Cor 6:19; Eph 2:22; Ezek 37:28**
