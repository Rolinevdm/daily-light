# Morning

**The fellowship of His sufferings.**
 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.
 
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. -- In the world ye shall have tribulation. -- Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
 
I looked for some to take pity, but there was none. -- At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.
 
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
 
Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.  

**Phl 3:10; Matt 10:25; Isa 53:3; John 16:33; John 15:19; Psa 69:20; 2 Tim 4:16; Matt 8:20; Heb 13:14; Heb 12:1,2**

# Evening

**They overcame ... by the blood of the Lamb.**
 
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died. -- It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. -- I am the LORD. The blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.
 
There is ... no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
 
What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  

**Rev 12:11; Rom 8:33,34; Lev 17:11; Exo 12:12,13; Rom 8:1; Rev 7:13,14; Rev 1:5,6**
