# Morning

**The whole family in heaven and earth.**
 
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. -- Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. -- That in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.
 
He is not ashamed to call them brethren. -- Behold my mother and my brethren! Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. -- Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father.
 
I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: ... and white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. -- That they without us should not be made perfect.  

**Eph 3:15; Eph 4:6; Gal 3:26; Eph 1:10; Heb 2:11; Matt 12:49,50; John 20:17; Rev 6:9-11; Heb 11:40**

# Evening

**After this manner ... pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven.**
 
Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father. -- My Father, and your Father.
 
Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
 
Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son.
 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
 
I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.  

**Matt 6:9; John 17:1; John 20:17; Gal 3:26; Rom 8:15,16; Gal 4:6,7; John 16:23,24; 2 Cor 6:17,18**
