# Morning

**Being made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.**
 
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. -- When ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
 
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
 
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. -- Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
 
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. -- I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  

**Rom 6:18; Matt 6:24; Rom 6:20-22; Rom 10:4; John 12:26; Matt 11:29,30; Isa 26:13; Psa 119:32**

# Evening

**Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall he saved.**
 
Manasseh did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, and he reared up altars for Baal. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. -- And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. -- And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- The Lord is longsuffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish.  

**Acts 2:21; 2 Kgs 21:1,2,3,5,6; 2 Chr 33:12,13; Isa 1:18; 2 Pet 3:9**
