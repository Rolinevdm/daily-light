As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.+ +I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. -- God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  |John 17:22; Isa 6:1-3; John 12:41; Ezek 1:26,28; Exo 33:18,20; John 1:18; 2 Cor 4:6|<strong>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</strong>+ +She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. -- Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.+ +Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.+ +Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.+ +None of us liveth to himself. -- Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. -- Take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
