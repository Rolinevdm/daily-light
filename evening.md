**Adam... begat a son in his own likeness.**
 
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? -- Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
 
Dead in trespasses and sins; ... by nature the children of wrath, even as others. -- I am carnal, sold under sin. That which I do I allow not; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.
 
By one man sin entered into the world, ... by one man's disobedience many where made sinners. -- If through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
 
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
 
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
