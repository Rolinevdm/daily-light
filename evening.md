**Evening**

**The offence of the cross.**
 
If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
 
Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. -- We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. -- Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence.
 
God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. -- I am crucified with Christ. -- They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.
