**Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.**
 
The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 
Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but feIlowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. -- If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
 
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.  

**Isa 60:18; Rev 21:14; Eph 2:19-22,1 Pet 2:3; Psa 65:1**
