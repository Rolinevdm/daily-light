**We are his workmanship.**
 
They brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. -- The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
 
Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house. -- Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. -- Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God.
 
Ye are God's building. -- Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. -- Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the eamest of the Spirit.
