**Evening**

**Thy kingdom come.**
 
In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. -- A stone ... cut out without hands. -- Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. -- The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
 
Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
 
Be ye ... ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
 
The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.
