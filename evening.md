**Is his mercy clean gone for ever?**
 
His mercy endureth for ever. -- The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy. -- Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity? ... he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sin into the depths of the sea. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us.
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
 
A merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
