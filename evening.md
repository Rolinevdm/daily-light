**God ... giveth ... liberally, and upbraideth not.**
 
Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
 
The grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many ... The free gift is of many offences unto justi-fication.
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
