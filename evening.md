**God is faithful.**
 
God is not a man that he should lie; neither the Son of man that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? -- The Lord sware and will not repent.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the im-mutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. -- Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day -- Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. -- All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
