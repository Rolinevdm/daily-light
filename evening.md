**Evening**

**He is able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.**
 
I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Is any thing too hard for the LORD!
 
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
