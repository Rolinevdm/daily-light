**Evening**

**Fellow citizens with the saints.**
 
Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.
 
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. -- Our conversation (Gr. citizenship) is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. -- The Father, ... hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.
 
As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.
