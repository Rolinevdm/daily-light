**I have exalted one chosen out of the people.**
 
Verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren. -- Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. -- The Son of man ... which is in heaven. -- Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
 
He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. -- Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
