**Evening**

**The things which are.**
 
Now we see through a glass, darkly. -- Now we see not yet all things put under him.
 
We have ... a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. -- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
 
Beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. -- The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.
 
Little children, it is the last time. -- The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
