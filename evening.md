**Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.**
 
The  Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the  glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. --  Thou are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy  lips. -- All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which  proceeded out of his mouth.
 
Ye have tasted that the Lord is  gracious. -- He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in  himself. -- We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen.
 
O  taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth  in him. -- I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit  was sweet to my taste.
 
He said unto me, My grace is sufficient  for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. -- Unto every one  of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. --  As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to  another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
