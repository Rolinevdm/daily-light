**Evening**

**There was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.**
 
This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud,... and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. -- An everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure. -- That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.
 
We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto their children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.  

**Rev 4:3; Gen 9:12,13,16; 2 Sam 23:5; Heb 6:18; Acts 13:32; Heb 13:8**
