**Evening**

**Riches are not forever; and doth the crown endure to every generation?**
 
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. -- Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
 
They do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptble. -- We look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen. -- To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. -- There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing. -- A crown of glory that fadeth not away.
