**Then said the princes of the Phillstines, What do these Hebrews here?**
 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye: for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, ... or as a busybody in other men's matters.
 
Let not ... your good be evil spoken of. -- Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles.
 
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? Ye are the temple of the living God. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.
 
Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people: that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.  

**1 Sam 29:3; 1 Pet 4:14,15; Rom 14:16; 1 Pet 2:12; 2 Cor 6:14,16,17; 1 Pet 2:9**
