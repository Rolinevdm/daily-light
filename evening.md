**Evening**

**Yet a little while, (Gr. how little, how little,) and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.**
 
Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
 
Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentence. -- Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy and truth. -- Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down. For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
