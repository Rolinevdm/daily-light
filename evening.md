**Evening**

**He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.**
 
The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
 
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
 
Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? -- In him we live, and move, and have our being. -- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
 
He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
