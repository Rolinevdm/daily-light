**Evening**

**He set my feet upon a rock.**
 
That Rock was Christ. -- Simon Peter ... said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God. Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. -- Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
 
Full assurance of faith. Faith without wavering. -- Faith, nothing wavering ... He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
