**Evening**

**Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.**
 
Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou has caused me to hope. -- O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
 
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. -- Ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.
 
Fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. -- Be strong, ... and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts. -- Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
 
Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
