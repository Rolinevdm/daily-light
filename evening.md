**Evening**

**Ye that are the Lord's remembrancers, keep not silence.**
 
Thou ... hast made us unto our God kings and priests. -- The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
 
I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. -- Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven. -- The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. -- Pray one for another: the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
 
Come, Lord Jesus. -- Make no tarrying, O my God. -- Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God.
