**Evening**

**Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?**
 
The church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
 
Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
 
There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun. -- The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.
 
The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.
