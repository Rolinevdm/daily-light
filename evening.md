**Evening**

**Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.**
 
If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother ... Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. -- When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
 
Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. -- Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
 
The apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.  

**Eph 4:26; Matt 18:15,21,22; Mark 11:25; Col 3:12,13; Eph 4:32; Luke 17:5**
