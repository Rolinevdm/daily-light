**My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?**
 
He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; ... the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all ... For the transgression of my people was he stricken ... It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.
 
Jesus our Lord ... was delivered for our offences. -- Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
 
He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.
