**The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.**
 
She did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold. Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and I will recover my wool and my flax.
 
All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord our God, all this store ... cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. -- Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
 
The living God ... giveth us richly all things to enjoy. -- Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
