**Evening**

**Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.**
 
I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. -- I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases. -- He restoreth my soul. -- O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
 
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.
 
I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
