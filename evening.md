**Evening**

**Give us this day our daily bread.**
 
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. -- His bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. -- The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
 
He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, ... that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. -- Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
