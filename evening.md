**Evening**

**He that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.**
 
The joy of the Lord is your strength. -- The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. -- Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
By him ... let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
 
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. -- Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing. -- We glory in tribulations also.
