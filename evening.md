**Evening**

**I have glorified thee on the earth.**
 
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. -- I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
 
Wist ye not that I must be about my Fatherâ€™s business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. -- This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
 
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. -- Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well -- All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his mouth.
 
Thou art worthy ... for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and peopIe, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
