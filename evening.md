**One God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.**
 
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD. -- A mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
 
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies ... Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
 
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
 
He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
