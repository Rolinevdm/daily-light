**Who redeemeth thy life from destruction.**
 
Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name. -- I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.
 
As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
 
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
 
Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. -- When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.  

**Psa 103:4; Jer 50:34; Hos 13:14; Heb 2:14,15; John 3:36; Col 3:3,4; 2 Thes 1:10**
