**I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.**
 
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect. -- Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God. -- The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
 
I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. -- I will bless the Lord all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
 
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion. -- They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty. -- Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me. -- Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. -- Rejoice in the Lord, always; and again I say, Rejoice.
