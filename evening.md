**After this manner ... pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven.**
 
Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father. -- My Father, and your Father.
 
Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.
 
Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son.
 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
 
I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
