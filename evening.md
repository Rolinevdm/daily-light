**Things which are despised, hath God chosen.**
 
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
 
Jesus, ... saw two brethren, ... casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me. -- Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
 
My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
 
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God.
