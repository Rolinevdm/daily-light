**Evening**

**Master, carest thou not that we perish?**
 
The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
 
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. -- While the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.
 
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. -- God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
 
Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. -- Trust ... in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.
