**Evening**

**He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.**
 
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
 
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. -- There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain,
 
The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. -- The Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.
