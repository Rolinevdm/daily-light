**My son, give me thine heart.**
 
O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
 
Thy heart is not right in the sight of God. -- Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
 
They ... first gave their own selves to the Lord. -- In every work that [Heze-kiah] began ... to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
 
Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
 
Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord. -- As the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men.
 
I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
