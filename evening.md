**Evening**

**Thou hearest me always.**
 
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. -- Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. -- Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. -- Not my will, but thine, be done.
 
As he is, so are we in this world. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.
 
Whatsoever we ask. we receive of him, because we keep his command-ments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
 
Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
 
He ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
