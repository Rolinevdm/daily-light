**Evening**

**Thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes.**
 
The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. -- Your Father which is in heaven: ... maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetâ€‘smelling savour. -- Be ye kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. -- The love of Christ constraineth us.
 
Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
