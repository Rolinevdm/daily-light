**Evening**

**Base things of the world hath God chosen.**
 
Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
 
You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world; among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
 
According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.
 
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  

**1 Cor 1:28; 1 Cor 6:9-11; Eph 2:1-3; Tit 3:5,6; Isa 55:8**
