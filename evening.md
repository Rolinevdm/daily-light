**The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.**
 
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. -- Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. -- I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith. -- He that is spiritual judgeth all things.
 
Take heed what ye hear. -- I know thy works, ... and how thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars. -- Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
 
He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
