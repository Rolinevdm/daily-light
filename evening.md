**Evening**

**There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.**
 
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
 
Be ye therefore perfect. -- Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
 
I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment.
 
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
 
There remaineth ... a rest for the people of God. -- Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.
