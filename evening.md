**My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.**
 
She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. -- Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
 
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.
 
Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.
 
None of us liveth to himself. -- Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. -- Take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. When ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
 
All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
