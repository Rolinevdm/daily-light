**Evening**

**Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning.**
 
The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? -- We had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us. -- The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
 
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. -- Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.
 
Be instant in season, out of season. -- Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.
 
Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. -- Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
