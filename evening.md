**Evening**

**I am ... the bright and morning Star. There shall come a star out of Jacob.**
 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bethel.
 
Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
 
I am the light of the world. -- I will give him the morning star.
 
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: ... lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
