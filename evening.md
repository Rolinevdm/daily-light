**Christ the firstfruits.**
 
Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. -- If the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy, so are the branches. -- Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. -- If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. -- The Lord Jesus Christ ... shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
 
The firstborn from the dead. -- If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
 
I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
