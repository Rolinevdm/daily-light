**Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified.**
 
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- The chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
Christ ... loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. -- To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. -- Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
 
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. -- Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
