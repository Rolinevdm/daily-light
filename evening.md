**Evening**

**That blessed hope, ... the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.**
 
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil: whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus. -- Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things. -- When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.
 
The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, ... groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
 
Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
