**Evening**

**The Son of God, ... hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire.**
 
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. -- Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. -- The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
 
Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. -- He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
 
The Lord knoweth them that are his. -- I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
