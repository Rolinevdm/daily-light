**Evening**

**What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise.**
 
This is not your rest: ... it is polluted, it shall destroy you. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. -- If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. -- Set your heart and your soul to seek your God: arise therefore.
 
Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. -- Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
 
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. -- Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- Now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. -- Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he finds you sleeping.
