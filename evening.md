**Evening**

**The children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.**
 
Thus saith the LORD, because the Syrians have said, the LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD. And they pitched one over against the other seven days; and so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. -- Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
 
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
 
They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.
