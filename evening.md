**Evening**

**If the Lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be?**
 
Have faith in God. -- Without faith it is impossible to please God. -- With God all things are possible.
 
Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver?
 
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. -- Prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
 
Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. -- LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many or with them that have no power.
 
We should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.
