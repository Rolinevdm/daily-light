**Ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son**.
 
He received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
 
The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
 
Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame. -- These things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. -- As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
