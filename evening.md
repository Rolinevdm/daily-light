**Evening**

**Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.**
 
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
 
That which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be.
 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.  

**Psa 97:11; Psa 126:5,6; 1 Cor 15:27; 1 Pet 1:3,6,7**
