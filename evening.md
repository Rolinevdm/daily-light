**Evening**

**In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. When my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.**
 
O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me. -- Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. it:
 
I am but a litile child: I know not how to go out or come in. -- If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, ... and it shall be given him.
 
Who is sufficient for these things? -- I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing. -- My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee ... Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
 
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; ... when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
