**Evening**

**Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.**
 
Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: ... and thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: ... and when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.
 
[Jesus] is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- The smoke of the in-cense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Pray without ceasing.
