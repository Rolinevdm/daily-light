**Evening**

**Watchman, what of the night?**
 
It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
 
Learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
 
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
 
Watch, ... for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.  

**Isa 21:11; Rom 13:11,12; Matt 24:32,33,35; Psa 130:5,6; Rev 22:20; Matt 25:13**
