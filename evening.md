**Evening**

**There shall be no night there.**
 
The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
 
The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. -- They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.
 
Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. -- Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. -- Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.
 
We are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
