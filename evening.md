**His dear Son.**
 
Lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. -- Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth. -- The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.
 
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love.
 
The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. -- Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.
