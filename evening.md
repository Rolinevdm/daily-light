**Evening**

**I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me.**
 
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
 
My speech and my preaching was ... in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
 
Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty. -- We shall see him as he is. -- In my flesh I shall see God. -- I shall be satisfied.
