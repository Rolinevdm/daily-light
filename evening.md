**Evening**

**It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt.**
 
The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
 
He ... kneeled down, and prayed. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
 
It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: ... they took Jesus, and led him away, ... into a place called ... Golgotha: where they crucified him.
 
Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast.
