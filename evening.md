**Evening**

**Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.**
 
A new heart ... will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes. Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them.
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
 
Have faith in God. Verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  

**Isa 45:11; Ezek 36:26,27,37; Matt 18:19,20; Mark 11:22,23**
