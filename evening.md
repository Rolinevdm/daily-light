**The measure of faith.**
 
Him that is weak in the faith. -- Strong in faith, giving glory to God.
 
O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? -- Great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.
 
Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord ... According to your faith be it unto you.
 
Lord, increase our faith. -- Building up yourselves on your most holy faith. -- Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith. -- He which stablisheth us with you in Christ, ... is God. -- The God of all grace ... after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
 
We ... that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. -- Let us not ... judge one another ... but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brotherâ€™s way.
