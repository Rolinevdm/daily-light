**They constrained him, saying, Abide with us.**
 
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. -- Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? -- I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go.
 
Let my beloved come into his garden. and eat his pleasant fruits. -- I am come into my garden. -- I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.
 
Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. -- I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. -- Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- The world seeth me no more; but, ye see me.
