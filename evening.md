**What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ... Lord, that I may receive my sight.**
 
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
 
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. -- The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, ... shall teach you all things. -- Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.
 
The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, ... give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.  

**Luke 18:41; Psa 119:18; Luke 24:45; Eph 1:17**
