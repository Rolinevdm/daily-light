**Evening**

**Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.**
 
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground. -- We commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. -- Study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands.
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- The night cometh when no man can work.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- Always abounding in the work of the Lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
 
There remaineth ... a rest to the people of God. -- Unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. -- This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing.
