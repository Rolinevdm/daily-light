**Evening**

**I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.**
 
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me. -- It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.
 
I beseech you, ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. -- Jesus ... that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. -- Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
