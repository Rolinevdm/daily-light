**Evening**

**He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.**
 
The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. -- Rest in the LORD. -- He that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works.
 
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace. -- That ... we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.
 
I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
