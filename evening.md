**Keep yourselves from idols.**
 
My son, give me thine heart. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
 
Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them? -- Mortify ... your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry. -- They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things.
 
If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. -- My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
 
Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. -- The Lord looketh on the heart.
