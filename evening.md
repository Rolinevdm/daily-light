**Evening**

**The communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.**
 
I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. -- He shall not speak of himself. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
 
The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. -- Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
 
Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. -- The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we would pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
