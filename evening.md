**Evening**

**Is it well with thee? And she answered, it is well.**
 
We having the same spirit of faith.
 
As chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
 
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
 
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  

**2 Kgs 4:26; 2 Cor 4:13; 2 Cor 6:9,10; 2 Cor 4:8-10,16-18; 21 John 2**
