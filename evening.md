**Evening**

**He is before all things.**
 
The Amen; the beginning of the creation of God. -- The beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre eminence.
 
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: when he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep; when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment. I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him. -- Yea, before the day was I am he.
 
The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. -- The author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
