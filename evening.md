**Evening**

**Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.**
 
If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? -- They provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
 
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
 
A whisperer separateth chief friends. -- There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. -- The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
 
Put off ... anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds. -- This is the will of God, even your sanctiflcation. -- In their mouth was found no guile.
