**Evening**

**Broken cisterns, that can hold no water.**
 
Eve ... bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.
 
Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven. The Lord scattered them. -- Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; it was well watered every where, even as the garden of the Lord. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
 
I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. -- I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I gathered me also silver and gold. Then I looked on all, and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit.
 
If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. -- He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
 
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
