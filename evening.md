**The words of the Lord are pure words.**
 
Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. -- The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. -- Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
 
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. -- Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. -- As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.
 
We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. -- Nor handling the word of God deceitfully.
