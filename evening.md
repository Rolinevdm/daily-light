**Evening**

**Jesus wept.**
 
A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. -- We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. -- It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. -- Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
 
I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
 
Behold how he loved. -- He took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. In all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
