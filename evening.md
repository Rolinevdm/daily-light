**Evening**

**[The woman's seed] shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.**
 
His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
This is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.
 
The Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. -- He cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
 
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. -- In my name shall they cast out devils.
 
The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
