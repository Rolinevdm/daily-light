**Evening**

**Forgive all my sins.**
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
 
Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
 
The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins. -- In Whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- Having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul, ... who forgives all thine iniquities.
