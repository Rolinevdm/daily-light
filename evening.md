**Evening**

**Now we call the proud happy.**
 
Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
 
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. -- Blessed are the poor in spirit for their's is the kingdom of heaven.
 
These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: a proud look, ... . -- Every one that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord.
 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
 
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you. -- Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
