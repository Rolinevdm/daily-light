**Why reason ye these things in your hearts?**
 
Being not weak in faith, [Abraham] considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred year's old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb; he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.
 
Is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? -- If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.
 
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. -- Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? -- Behold the fowls of the air; ... your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? -- Why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? Do ye not ... remember the five loaves of the five thousand?
 
My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
