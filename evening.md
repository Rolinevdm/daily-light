**Evening**

**The man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.**
 
In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. -- I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. -- I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me.
 
Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh. -- Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. -- Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.
 
Let all the angels of God worship him. Kings of kings, and Lord of lords.
