**Evening**

**We would see Jesus.**
 
O LORD, we have waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
 
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
 
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. -- Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
 
Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.
 
Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. -- Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.
 
Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
