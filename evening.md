**Evening**

**Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.**
 
Enoch walked with God. -- Can two walk together, except they be agreed? -- It is good for me to draw near to God.
 
The LORD is with you, while ye be with him: and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. When they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
 
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
 
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, ... and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.
