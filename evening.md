**Evening**

**Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth.**
 
The new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, ... so shall your seed and your name remain.
 
We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
 
I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
