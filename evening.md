**Evening**

**God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.**
 
Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. -- The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: -- because he is the Son of man. -- The Son of God, -- hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire.
 
They say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?--These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. -- There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
 
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. -- Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
