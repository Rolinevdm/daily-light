**Evening**

**I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God.**
 
I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. -- The LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. -- Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
 
Is any merry? let him sing psalms. -- Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the LORD; giving thanks always for all things. -- Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
 
At midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. -- Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again, I say, Rejoice.
