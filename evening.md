**Evening**

**The judgment seat.**
 
We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth. -- When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.
 
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. -- There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
 
We are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
