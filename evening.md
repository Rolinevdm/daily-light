**Evening**

**The Son of man came to give his life a ransom for many.**
 
If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
 
He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter. -- I lay down my life for the sheep. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
 
The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. -- Without shedding of blood is no remission.
 
While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
