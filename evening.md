**Evening**

**I will be as the dew unto Israel.**
 
The meekness and gentleness of Christ.
 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
 
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he began to say unto thern, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.
 
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
 
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.  

**Hos 14:5; 2 Cor 10:1; Isa 42:3; Luke 4:18,19,21,22; Luke 22:61,62; Isa 40:11**
