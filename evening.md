**Evening**

**The eyes of all wait upon thee.**
 
He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things. -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. -- Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.
 
The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. -- Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God.
 
The Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him. -- And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. -- If we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
