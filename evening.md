**Evening**

**Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.**
 
First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. -- Till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.
 
They measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
 
The body is of Christ. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, and not holding the Head from which all the body by joints and bands, having nourishment ministered and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
 
Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  

**Eph 4:15; Matt 4:28; Eph 4:13; 2 Cor 10:12,17,18; Col 2:17-19; 2 Pet 3:18**
