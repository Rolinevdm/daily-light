**Evening**

**Gold tried in the fire.**
 
There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. -- Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
 
The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. -- In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world  

**Rev 318; Mark 10:29,30; 1 Pet 4:12; 1 Pet 1:6,7; 1 Pet 5:10; John 16:33**
