**Evening**

**O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.**
 
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
 
I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. -- He ... became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
 
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? -- Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
