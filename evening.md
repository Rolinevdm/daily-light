**Evening**

**The darkness hideth not from thee.**
 
His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. -- Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? ... Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
 
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; ... nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ... Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. -- He that keepeth thee will not slumber. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.  

**Psa 139:12; Job 34:21,2; Jer 23:24; Psa 91:5,6,9,10; Psa 121:3,5; Psa 23:4**
