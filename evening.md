**Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.**
 
The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty: thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
 
The LORD is ... great in power. -- If God be for us, who can be against us? -- Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us. -- My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. -- Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
 
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. -- Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
