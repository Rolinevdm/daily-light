**Everlasting consolation.**
 
I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
 
By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. -- He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. -- Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? -- The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. -- So shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore cormfort one another with these words.
 
This is not your rest. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
