**Lead me in thy truth, and teach me**
 
When ... the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth. -- Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
 
To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. -- All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. -- The holy Scriptures ... are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. -- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. -- The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
