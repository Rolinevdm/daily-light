**Evening**

**Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.**
 
It came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
 
Job spake, and said, Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures? -- Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.
 
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. -- In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
