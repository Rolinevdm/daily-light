**Evening**

**Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.**
 
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. -- The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. -- The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
 
Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings: and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
