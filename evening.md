**Evening**

**Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.**
 
If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. -- Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. I will; be thou clean. -- Faith as a grain of mustard seed.
 
Cast not away ... your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. -- Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
 
First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord. -- The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. -- So run, that ye may obtain.
 
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.
