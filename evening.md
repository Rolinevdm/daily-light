**Evening**

**Occupy till I come.**
 
The Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. -- Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. -- Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? -- Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. -- Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it. -- Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
