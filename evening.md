**Evening**

**Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.**
 
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
 
Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven. I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolators; for then must we needs go out of the world. I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. -- That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.
 
In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.  

**Eph 5:11; 1 Cor 15:33; 1 Cor 5:6,7,9-11; Phl 2:15; 2 Tim 2:20**
