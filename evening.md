**Evening**

**The triumphing of the wicked is short.**
 
Thou shalt bruise his heel. -- This is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- As the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. -- Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
 
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith. -- Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
 
The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. -- The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. -- The devil ... was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone ... and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
