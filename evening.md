**Noah was a just man.**
 
The just shall live by faith. -- Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour. -- The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
 
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference.
 
We ... joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect ? It is God that justifieth. -- Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified.
