**Evening**

**Enoch walked with God.**
 
Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
 
Having made peace through the blood of his cross ... You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight. -- In Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
 
If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
