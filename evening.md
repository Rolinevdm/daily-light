**Evening**

**Fight the good fight of faith.**
 
We were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. -- Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. -- Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
 
Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. -- God is my strength and power: ... he teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. -- Our sufficiency is of God.
 
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. -- Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
 
The time would fail me to tell of [those] who through faith subdued kingdoms, ... out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
