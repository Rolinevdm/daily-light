**Evening**

**As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place therof shall know it no more.**
 
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. -- What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
 
Surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
 
Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. -- Use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. -- Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
