**Evening**

**The Lord's portion is his people.**
 
Ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. -- I am his. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. -- The Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.
 
Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. -- Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. -- A spiritual house, an holy priesthood.
 
They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels. -- All mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. -- The glory of his inheritance in the saints.
