**Evening**

**Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.**
 
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Serve the LORD with gladness; come before his presence with singing. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. -- For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
He ... spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. -- Having yet ... one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him.
 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! -- Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
 
My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
