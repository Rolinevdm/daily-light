**It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.**
 
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
 
We have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected us; and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
 
Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. -- Humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.
