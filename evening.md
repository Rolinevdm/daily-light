**A new name.**
 
The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. -- Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. -- They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. -- Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
 
God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
 
Be ye ... followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints. Now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.  

**Rev 2:17; Acts 11:26; 2 Tim 2:19; Gal 5:24; 1 Cor 6:20; Gal 6:14,15; Eph 5:1â€‘3,8**
