**Evening**

**In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.**
 
When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (the lust of the flesh), and that it was pleasant to the eyes (the lust of the eyes), and a tree to be desired to make one wise (the pride of life), she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 
When the tempter came to [Jesus], he said, if thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread (the lust of the flesh). But he answered, ... Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The devil ... sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them (the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life). Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan.
 
In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
 
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.
