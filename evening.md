**Thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. **
 
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. -- The same yesterday, and today, and forever.
 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
 
God is not a man, that he should lie: neither the son of man, that he should repent. -- It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
 
This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. -- Fear not; I am the first and the last.
