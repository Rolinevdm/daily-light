**He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him.**
 
And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. -- Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said unto God, ... Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people. -- And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
 
Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power ... O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa.
 
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
