**Evening**

**Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.**
 
We spend our years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. -- Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. -- I am the Lord, I change not. -- Our conversation (citizenship) is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. -- The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.
 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever. -- Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
