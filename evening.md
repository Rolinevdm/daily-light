**The choice vine.**
 
My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, ... and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. -- Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me.
 
The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, ... envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: ... but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
 
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Abide in me, and I in you ... Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.
