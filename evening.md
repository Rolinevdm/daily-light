**They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.**
 
This is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHT-EOUSNESS. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor. -- O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
 
The mighty God, The everlasting Father. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
The Prince of Peace. -- He is our peace. -- Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. -- Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help. -- As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.
