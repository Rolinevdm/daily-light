**Evening**

**The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.**
 
The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. -- Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?
 
I am the LORD, and there is none else; there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
 
He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the in-habitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? -- If God be for us, who can be against us?
 
He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. -- Fear not, little flock; for it is your Fatherâ€™s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
