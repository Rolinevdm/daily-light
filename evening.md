**Evening**

**Dost thou believe on the Son of God?**
 
Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
 
The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. -- I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
 
Lord, I believe. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious.
