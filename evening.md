**Consolation in Christ, ... comfort of love, ... fellowship of the Spirit.**
 
Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and con-tinueth not. -- My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
 
The Father ... shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name. -- Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
 
If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  

**Phl 2:1; Job 14:1,2; Psa 73:26; John 14:16,26; 2 Cor 1:3,4; 1 Thes 4:14,17,18**
