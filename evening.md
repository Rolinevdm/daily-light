**Evening**

**I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.**
 
Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down! -- As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? -- Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
 
Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. -- Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. -- God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope. -- Whom having not seen, ye love.
 
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. -- It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
