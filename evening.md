**Evening**

**I am thy part and thine inheritance.**
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee! and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. -- The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
 
The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is ... Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
 
My beloved is mine, and I am his.
