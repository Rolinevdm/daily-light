**Write the  things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.**
 
Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. -- That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
 
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. -- He that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
 
We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. -- That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
