**Evening**

**My feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.**
 
When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
 
The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.
 
A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again. -- Although he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
 
Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise: when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. -- He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
 
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
