**Evening**

**Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.**
 
All power is give unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: ... and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea.
 
Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not gospel! I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
 
Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. -- My word ... shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. -- So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  

**Luke 5:5; Matt 28:18â€‘20; Matt 13:47; 1 Cor 9:16,22; Gal 6:9; Isa 55:11; 1 Cor 3:7**
