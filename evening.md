**Evening**

**One star differeth from another star in glory.**
 
By the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all. -- Be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.
 
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.
 
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righeousness as the stars for ever and ever.
