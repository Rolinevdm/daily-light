**Evening**

**She hath done what she could.**
 
This poor widow hath cast in more than they all. -- Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. -- If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.
 
Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. -- If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? -- He which soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of
 
necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
 
When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
