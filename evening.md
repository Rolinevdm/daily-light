**His name shall be in their foreheads.**
 
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep. -- The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
 
The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. -- Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
 
After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance. -- Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
 
I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. -- This is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.
