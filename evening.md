**Evening**

**All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.**
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. -- I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. -- Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
 
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
 
My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
 
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
