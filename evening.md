**Things that are pleasing in his sight.**
 
Without faith it is impossible to please him. -- So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. -- The Lord taketh pleasure in his people.
 
This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. -- The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ... is in the sight of God of great price.
 
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. -- I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
 
I beseech you, ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
