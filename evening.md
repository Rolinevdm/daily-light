**Seek ye out of the book of the Lord.**
 
Ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. -- This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
 
The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. -- By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. -- Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
 
We have ... a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. -- That we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
