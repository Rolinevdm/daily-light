**Evening**

**Thou wilt shew me the path of life.**
 
Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. -- I will teach you the good and the right way. -- I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Follow me.
 
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the ends thereof are the ways of death. -- Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
 
An highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.
 
In my Fatherâ€™s house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
