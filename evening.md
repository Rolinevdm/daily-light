**Them that honour me I will honour.**
 
Whosoever ... shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. -- He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
 
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
 
Fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
 
Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. -- Praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
