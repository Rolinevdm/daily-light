**Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.**
 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. -- Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
 
He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. -- Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
 
Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
 
I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
