**Evening**

**Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.**
 
I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. -- Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. -- Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
 
Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. -- Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity? ... he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. -- Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
