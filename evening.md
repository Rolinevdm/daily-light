**Evening**

**He smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed.**
 
All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that rock was Christ. -- One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. -- My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
 
If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. -- Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
