**Evening**

**The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.**
 
The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. -- What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God? -- It is God which worketh in you.
 
We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.
 
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
