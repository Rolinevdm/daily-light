**Yea, hath God said?**
 
When the tempter came to Jesus, he said, If thou be the Son of God. -- Jesus said unto him, It is written, ... it is written, ... it is written. -- Then the devil leaveth him.
 
I may not return with thee. For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there. He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. So he went back with him. The man of God ... was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD. -- Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. -- Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
