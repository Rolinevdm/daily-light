**Evening**

**I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.**
 
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust. -- Even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings. -- He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
 
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. -- The darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- Ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. -- I will trust, and not be afraid.
