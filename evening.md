**Evening**

**Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.**
 
How forcible are right words! -- I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.
 
They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. -- If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
 
The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone. -- Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
 
Let ... no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. -- Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
