**Evening**

**The day of temptation in the wilderness.**
 
Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
 
Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
 
He himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. -- Simon, Simon, ... Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.
