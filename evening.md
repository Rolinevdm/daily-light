**Evening**

**When shall I arise, and the night be gone?**
 
Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh.
 
Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds.
 
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you.
 
Let all thine enemies perish, O Lord; but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. -- Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
There shall be no night there.
