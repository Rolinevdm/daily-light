<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>What things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</strong>
 
The LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. -- I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
 
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart. -- My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
 
Them that are sanctified by God the Father. -- He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.
 
Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. -- The fulness of him that filleth all in all.
 
I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour. -- This is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
 
Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
