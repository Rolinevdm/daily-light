<strong>Jehovahâ€‘shalom: (The Lord send peace.)</strong>
 
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
 
Behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. -- My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places; when it shall hail, coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place.
 
He is our peace. -- This man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land.These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.
