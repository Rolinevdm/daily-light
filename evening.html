<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. (Or, change strength.)</strong>
 
When I am weak, then am I strong. -- God shall be my strength. -- He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. -- Let him take hold of my strength.
 
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee. -- The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.
 
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
 
Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. -- Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
