<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The dust shall return to the earth as it was.</strong>
 
It is sown in corruption; it is sown in dishonour; it is sown in weakness; it is sown a natural body. -- The first man is of the earth, earthy.
 
Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. -- One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
 
My flesh ... shall rest in hope. -- Though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. -- The Lord Jesus Christ shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
 
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. -- So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
