<strong>They talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</strong>
 
I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
 
He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. -- Comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
 
Let us not ... judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. -- We ... that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.
 
Charity ... rejoiceth not in iniquity. -- Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
