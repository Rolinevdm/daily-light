<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Spirit ... maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God</strong>.
 
Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.
 
This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us; and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. -- This is the will of God, even your sanctification.
 
God hath ... called us ... unto holiness: ... who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
 
Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit.
