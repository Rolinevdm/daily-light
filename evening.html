<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee.</strong>
 
If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. -- O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
 
The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.
 
I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. -- I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
