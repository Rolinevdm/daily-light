<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</strong>
 
No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
 
He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. -- Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. -- What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
 
Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: but speaking the truth in love, ... grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ.
 
Abide in me. -- Be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
