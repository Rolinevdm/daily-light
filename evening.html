<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The floods lift up their waves.</strong>
 
The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. -- O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
 
Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
 
Peter ... walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
