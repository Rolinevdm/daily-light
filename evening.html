<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord.</strong>
 
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. -- Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
 
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. -- Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. -- Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
