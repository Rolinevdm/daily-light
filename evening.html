<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things they had done.</strong>
 
There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. -- The Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. -- Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
 
When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
 
Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
 
In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. -- The prayer of the upright is his delight.
