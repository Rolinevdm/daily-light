<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Nicodemus ... he that came to Jesus by night.</strong>
 
Peter followed him afar off. -- Among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. -- The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.
 
Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench. -- Faith as a grain of mustard seed.
 
God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord. -- Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. -- Whosoever ... shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
