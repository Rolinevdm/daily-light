<strong>O Lord God, ... with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</strong>
 
Thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever. -- The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
 
Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. -- When thou makest a feast call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. -- Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
 
Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
 
The LORD God is a sun and shield.
