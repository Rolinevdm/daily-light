<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>What communion hath light with darkness?</strong>
 
Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. -- Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 
Darkness hath blinded his eyes. -- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
 
The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. -- Love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
 
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.
