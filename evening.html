<strong>God created man in his own image.</strong>
 
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. -- For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
 
We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
 
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. -- If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ.
