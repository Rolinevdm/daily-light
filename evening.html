<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>All we like sheep have gone astray.</strong>
 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. -- There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable.
 
Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. -- I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteous for his name's sake.
 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, either shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
 
What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
