<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>My kingdom is not of this world.</strong>
 
This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies may be made his footstool. -- Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
 
He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
 
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. -- He shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.
