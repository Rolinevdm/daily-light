<strong>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord! for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</strong>
 
Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
 
Thou shalt not be forgotten of me. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins.
 
Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. -- A woman ... cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David! But he answered her not a word.
 
The trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth.
