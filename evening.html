<strong>The tree of life</strong>.
 
God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. -- He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.
 
To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. -- In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
 
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom. Length of days is in her right hand. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. -- Christ Jesus, ... is made unto us wisdom.
