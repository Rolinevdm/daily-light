<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Behold how he loved.</strong>
 
He died for all. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
 
He ... liveth to make intercession for them. -- I go to prepare a place for you.
 
I will come again, and receive you unto myself that where I am, there ye may be also. -- Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am. -- Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
 
We love him, because he first loved loved us. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.
 
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
