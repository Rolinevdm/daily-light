<strong>Our Lord Jesus Christ, ... though he was rich, yet for your sakes ... became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</strong>
 
It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. -- Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation.
 
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
 
All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God's.
