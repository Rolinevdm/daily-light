<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong>
 
Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. -- He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.
 
Messias ... which is called Christ. -- The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives.
 
The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. The second man is the Lord from heaven. -- My Lord and my God. -- Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
