<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</strong>
 
From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <em>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</em> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? -- The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
 
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. -- Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.
 
God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. -- That he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
