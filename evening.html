<strong>It is the spirit that quickeneth.</strong>
 
The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. -- That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.
 
If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
 
I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God. -- Reckon ye ... yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
