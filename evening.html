<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Let us put on the armour of light.</strong>
 
Put ... on the Lord Jesus Christ. -- That I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. -- The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.
 
He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them. All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Awake thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly.
