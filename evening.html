<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.</strong>
 
Heirs of God, and joint‑heirs with Christ. -- All things are your’s. -- My beloved is mine. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me.
 
The Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.
 
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land.
