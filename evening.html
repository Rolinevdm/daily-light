<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Master, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see.</strong>
 
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. -- To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.
 
Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
 
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
 
Look, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. -- How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
