<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.</strong>
 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. -- By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. -- Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
 
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
