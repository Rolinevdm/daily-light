<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Who art thou Lord? I am Jesus.</strong>
 
It is I; be not afraid. -- When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee: and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, ... thy Saviour.
 
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. -- Emmanuel, God with us.
 
Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. -- If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
