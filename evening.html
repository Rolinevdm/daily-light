<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>They sang as it were a new song.</strong>
 
A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.
 
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. -- Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. -- Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. -- I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, ... cried ... saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
