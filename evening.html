<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</strong>
 
Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
 
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
 
I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
