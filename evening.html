<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me.</strong>
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil. -- My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
 
How precious ... are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. -- LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. -- Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to usward.
 
Not many mighty, not many noble, are called. -- Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom? -- Having nothing, and yet possessing all things. -- The unsearchable riches of Christ.
