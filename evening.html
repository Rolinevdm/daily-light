<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>He that overcometh shall inherit all things</strong>.
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. -- Now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city. -- An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.
 
All things are yours; ... the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours. -- Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
 
Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. -- Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.
