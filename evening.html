<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us.</strong>
 
He brought me up ... out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- God commendeth love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died us.
 
Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. -- Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
