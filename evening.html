<strong>Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</strong>
 
Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. -- Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. -- What will ye that I shall do unto you? They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
 
If ye ... being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? -- I will put my Spirit within you. Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of.
 
This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, what-soever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
