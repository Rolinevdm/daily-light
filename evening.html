<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Faith as a grain of mustard seed.</strong>
 
Barak said unto [Deborah], if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan. -- Gideon ... feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, ... did it by night. And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand as thou hast said, ... let me prove, I pray thee. And God did so.
 
Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. -- Who hath despised the day of small things?
 
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly. -- Lord, increase our faith. -- I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
