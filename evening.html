<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>My times are in thy hand.</strong>
 
All his saints are in thy hand. -- The word of the Lord came unto Elijah, saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. And the word of the Lord can unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
 
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
 
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. -- Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.
