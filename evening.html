<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I have trodden the winepress alone.</strong>
 
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree. -- Being made a curse for us.
 
O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. -- Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. -- He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
 
O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. -- They overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.
