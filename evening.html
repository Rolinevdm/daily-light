<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Behold, I make all things new.</strong>
 
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. -- If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
 
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. -- Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump. -- The new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
 
Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.
 
Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. -- Seeing ... that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?
