<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The sorrow of the world worketh death.</strong>
 
When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died. -- A wounded spirit who can bear?
 
Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? -- The LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. -- Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
 
Philip preached unto him Jesus. -- He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
