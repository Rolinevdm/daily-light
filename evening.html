<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Our friend sleepeth.</strong>
 
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
 
If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
 
It came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones ... and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. -- This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. -- Witnesses chosen before of God, ... who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
