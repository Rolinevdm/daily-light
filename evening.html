<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</strong>
 
They that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. -- They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. -- He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.
 
To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. -- He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
 
There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. -- The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. -- He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
