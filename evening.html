<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</strong>
 
Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
 
Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins, -- They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: for the redemption of their soul is precious. -- I have found a ransom. -- God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.
 
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
