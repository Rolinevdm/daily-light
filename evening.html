<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>My cup runneth over.</strong>
 
O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. -- His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
 
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. -- Whether ... the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours. -- Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
 
I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. -- Godliness with contentment is great gain. -- My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
