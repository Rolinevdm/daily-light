<strong>The Lord Our Righteousness.</strong>
 
We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.
 
I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. -- I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him. -- To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord ... that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
