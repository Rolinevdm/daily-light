<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.</strong>
 
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
 
Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. -- Having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
 
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise: and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty.
