<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Ebenezer ... Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</strong>
 
I was brought low, and he helped me. -- Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
 
It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. -- Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God. -- He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. -- There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord hath spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
 
When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. -- Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
