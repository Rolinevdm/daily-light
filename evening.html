<strong>Teach me thy way, O Lord.</strong>
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
 
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
 
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Having ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith.
 
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord. -- All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
