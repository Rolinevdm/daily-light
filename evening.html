<strong>What think ye of Christ?</strong>
 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. -- He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
 
Unto you ... which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner. -- Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
 
I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ. -- Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee.
