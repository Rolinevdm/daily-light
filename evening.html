<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.</strong>
 
Take heed therefore how ye hear. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. -- Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
 
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
 
Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. -- But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
