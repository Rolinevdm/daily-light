<strong>God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.</strong>
 
When the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud, ... a man lefthanded. After him was Shamgar, ... which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
 
The LORD looked upon [Gideon], and said, Go in this thy might: ... have not I sent thee? And he said unto him, O my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
 
The LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me, ... lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
 
Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. -- My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
