<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>We, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.</strong>
 
Put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts: and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and ... put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
 
Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. -- As Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
