<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>His word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</strong>
 
Necessity is laid upon me; yea woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. -- They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said unto them, ... We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. -- The love of Christ constraineth us.
 
I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth ... Thou wicked and slothful servant, ... thou oughtest ... to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
 
Go ... to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee.
