<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me.</strong>
 
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
 
He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For when I am weak, then am I strong.
 
When (Peter) saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? -- If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. -- Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power.
