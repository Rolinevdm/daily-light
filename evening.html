<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord Jesus Christ ... shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.</strong>
 
Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.
 
We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
 
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more. -- They sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.
