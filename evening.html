<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>A new and living way.</strong>
 
Cain went out from the presence of the Lord. -- Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you. -- Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord.
 
I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
 
The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing. -- He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us. -- The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
 
Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. -- Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
