<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>My sheep hear my voice.</strong>
 
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, 1 will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
 
I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled. I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
 
Speak; for thy servant heareth. -- When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. -- I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
