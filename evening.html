<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</strong>
 
The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. -- There is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. -- The first man Adam was made a living soul. -- The spirit of man that goeth upward.
 
Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are confident, ... and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. -- With Christ; which is far better. -- I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
 
I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
