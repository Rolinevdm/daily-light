<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Reproach hath broken my heart.</strong>
 
Is not this the carpenter's son? -- Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? -- Say we not well that thou are a Samaritan, and hast a devil? -- He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. -- We know that this man is a sinner. -- He deceiveth the people. -- This man blasphemeth. -- Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. -- This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. -- If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.
