<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Draw me, we will run after thee.</strong>
 
I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. -- I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. -- I, if I be lifted up from the eaith, will draw all men unto me. -- Behold the Lamb of God. -- As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
 
Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. -- We love him, because he first loved us.
 
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
