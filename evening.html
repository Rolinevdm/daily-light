<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The night cometh when no man can work.</strong>
 
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, ... they ... rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. -- There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. -- Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?
 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. -- The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.
 
I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: hence-forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.
 
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
