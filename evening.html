<strong>Thy word hath quickened me.</strong>
 
The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
 
As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself. -- I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
 
In him was life; and the life was the light of men ... As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
 
It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. -- The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
