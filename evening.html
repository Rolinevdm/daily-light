<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</strong>
 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
 
Let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me. -- Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.
 
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ. -- By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.
 
By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
