<strong>Jesus saith unto her, Mary.</strong>
 
Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by name: Thou art mine. -- The sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name. And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
 
Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. -- We have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.
 
Thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial. And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment. And thou shalt set in it four rows of stones. And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, ... and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord.
