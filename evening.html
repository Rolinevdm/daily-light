<strong>There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</strong>
 
Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses ... Jehonathan: and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri: and over the vineyards was Shimei. These were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.
 
God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
 
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
