<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Oh that I knew where I might find him!</strong>
 
Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.
 
Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. -- Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
 
Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
 
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
 
Look, I am with you alway. -- I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. -- The Comforter ... dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
