<strong>Let your requests be made known unto God.</strong>
 
Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. -- There was given to me a thorn in the flesh. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.
 
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. -- Hannah ... was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and ... wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life. The Lord remembered her.
 
We know not what we should pray for as we ought. -- He shall choose our inheritance for us.
