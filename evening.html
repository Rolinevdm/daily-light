<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord thy God accept thee.</strong>
 
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
 
We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. -- There is none righteous, no, not one. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. To declare ... at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 
Accepted in the Beloved. -- Ye are complete in him.
