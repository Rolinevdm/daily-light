<strong>They said, ... it is manna: for they wist not what it was.</strong>
 
Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh. -- The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
 
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. -- If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. -- My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
 
The children of Israel ... gathered, some more, some less. He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack. They gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating.
 
Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat: or, What shall we drink? Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
