<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Sanctification of the Spirit.</strong>
 
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
 
Behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! -- Fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth: proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
 
The Comforter is the Holy Ghost. -- The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.
 
In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
 
All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
