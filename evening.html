<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</strong>
 
There remaineth ... a rest to the people of God. -- My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. -- There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. -- They ... rest from their labours.
 
The forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavv laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. -- In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
