<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The fashion of this world passeth away.</strong>
 
All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
 
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. -- For what is your life? It is even a vapour of that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
 
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am. -- When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
