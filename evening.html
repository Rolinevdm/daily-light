<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</strong>
 
Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. -- Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. -- Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
 
He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ. -- The tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. -- Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt.
