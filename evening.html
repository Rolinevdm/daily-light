<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.</strong>
 
Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. -- We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night.
 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God. -- Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD.
 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. -- Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. -- Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.
 
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.
