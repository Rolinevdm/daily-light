<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</strong>
 
No man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation. -- In me ye ... have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
 
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- The night is far spent, the day is at hand. -- He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
 
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces. -- There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. -- We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
