<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.</strong>
 
Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap. Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not. Seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
 
Having food and raiment let us be therewith content ... They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
 
The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
 
Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.  

<strong>Luke 10:41; Luke 12:24,27,29,30; 1 Tim 6:8-10; Mark 4:19; Heb 12:1</strong>
