<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Thy will be done.</strong>
 
O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. -- Not as I will, but as thou wilt. -- Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
 
We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
 
Ye know not what ye ask. -- He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. -- These things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
 
I would have you without carefulness. -- Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
