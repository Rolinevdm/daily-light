<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day.</strong>
 
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. -- He that watereth shall be watered.
 
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest: behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. -- The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season. -- Occupy till I come.
 
I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
