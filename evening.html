<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</strong>
 
There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. -- There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. -- How can he be clean that is born of a woman?
 
Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
 
The Lord ... hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. -- Whom he justified, them he also glorified. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. -- If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel.
 
Walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
