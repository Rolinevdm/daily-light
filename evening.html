<strong>Raised up together in Christ Jesus.</strong>
 
Fear not; ... I am he that liveth. -- Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.
 
We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. -- He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead. -- Ye are complete in him, which is the head.
 
Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
 
This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
