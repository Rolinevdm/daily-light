<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</strong>
 
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. -- The Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
 
He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. -- As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
 
His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compas-sion toward them, and he healed their sick. -- The same yesterday, and today, and forever.
 
The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. Fear ye not therefore.
