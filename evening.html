<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>We glory in tribulations.</strong>
 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, rejoice. -- They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
 
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.
 
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
