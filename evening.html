<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Prince of Peace.</strong>
 
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. -- Glory to God ... on earth peace, good will toward men.
 
Through the tender mercy of our God; ... the dayspring from on high hath visited us. To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace; -- peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all).
 
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth give I unto you. -- The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
