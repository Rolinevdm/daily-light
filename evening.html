<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</strong>
 
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: he saith, ... Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
 
The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. --I believed, and therefore have I spoken. -- I know whom I have believed. -- I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
 
The goodness of God. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
 
As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
 
Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy.
