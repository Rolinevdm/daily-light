<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>[Jesus] prayed the third time, saying the same words.</strong>
 
Who in the days of his flesh ... offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death.
 
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord. -- Continuing instant in prayer. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication. -- By prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 
Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.
 
Delight thyself ... in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
