<strong>The mighty God.</strong>
 
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: there-fore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously ...Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. -- Thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty. -- The man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts.
 
Behold, God, is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. -- Thanks be unto God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ.
 
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
