<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>We have turned every one to his own way.</strong>
 
Noah ... planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. -- Abram ... said unto Sara his wife, ... Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake. -- Isaac said unto Jacob, ... Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. -- Moses ... spake unadvisedly with his lips. -- The men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. And Joshua made peace with them. -- David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
 
These all ... obtained a good report through faith. -- Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. -- The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
 
Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways.
