<strong>They overcame ... by the blood of the Lamb.</strong>
 
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died. -- It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. -- I am the LORD. The blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.
 
There is ... no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
 
What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
