<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The end of all things is at hand.</strong>
 
I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. -- The heavens and the earth, which are now, ... are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment.
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. -- Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.
 
We have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- We ... look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
