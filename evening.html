<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</strong>
 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.
 
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
 
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will guide thee with mine eye.
