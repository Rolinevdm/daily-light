<strong>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?</strong>
 
By the grace of God I am what I am. -- Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth. -- It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. -- Where is boasting then? It is excluded. -- Christ Jesus, ... is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: ... He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.
 
You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. -- Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
