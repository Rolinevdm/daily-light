<strong>Poor, yet making many rich.</strong>
 
Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. -- Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. -- My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. -- God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.
 
Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? -- Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.
 
We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
