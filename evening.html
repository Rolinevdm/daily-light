<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.</strong>
 
Moses said unto the LORD, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee. And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. -- He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
 
The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way. What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. -- Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
 
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. -- I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. -- The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
