<p><strong>Jehovahâ€‘shammah (The Lord is there.)</strong><br> <br>Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<br> <br>I saw no temple: ... for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.<br> <br>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.<br> <br>Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in Zion. -- Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. -- There shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.  </p>
