<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.</strong>
 
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. -- Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord, the first, and with the last: I am he.
 
Sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ. -- The very God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. -- Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? -- The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me.
 
It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
