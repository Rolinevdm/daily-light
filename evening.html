<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Keep yourselves in the love of God.</strong>
 
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
 
The fruit of the Spirit is love.
 
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. -- Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.
 
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. -- God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
