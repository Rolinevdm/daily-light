<strong>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee?</strong>
 
Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
 
The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. -- An high priest ... holy, harmless, undefiled.
 
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. -- The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
 
Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
