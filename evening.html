<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>God hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</strong>
 
My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, ... but now is my kingdom not from hence. -- Expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
 
The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. -- Thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. -- I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; ... and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. -- Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. -- Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
 
I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
 
Thy kingdom come.
