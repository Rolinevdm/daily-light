Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. -- Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
 
Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. -- Aaron held his peace. -- It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. -- Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.
 
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
