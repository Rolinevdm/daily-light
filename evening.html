<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The dew of Hermon.</strong>
 
Mount Sion, which is Hermon. -- There the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. -- I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
 
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass. -- As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
 
God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. -- And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. -- It is like the precious ointment upon the head ... even Aaron's ... that went down to the skirts of his garments.
