<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</strong>
 
The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. -- He left not himself without witness. -- Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
 
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. -- They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
