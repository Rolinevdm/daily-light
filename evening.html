<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</strong>
 
There fell some of Manasseh to David. And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour. -- The mani-festation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
 
Of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do. -- To one is given by the Spirit ... the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.
 
Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart. -- A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
 
There should be no schism in the body; but ... the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
 
One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
