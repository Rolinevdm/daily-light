<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>On that night could not the king sleep.</strong>
 
Thou holdest mine eyes waking. -- Who is like unto the Lord our God, ... who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
 
He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. -- Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. -- Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
 
The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. -- We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.
 
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
