<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</strong>
 
He brought me up ... out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. -- You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world. We all had our conversation in times past in the lusts our flesh.
 
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed. -- Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. -- We went through fire and through water: thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
 
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
