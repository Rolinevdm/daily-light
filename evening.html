<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</strong>
 
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; they ... rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
 
Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ... Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened. -- Ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope ... But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
