<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face.</strong>
 
Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, your sins have hid his face from you. -- My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: ... I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. -- I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on forwardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him. -- Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God when he led thee by the way?
 
He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. -- I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away.
 
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
