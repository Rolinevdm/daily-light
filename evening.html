<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</strong>
 
Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; ... it doth not appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of heavenly.
 
The Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; ... shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
 
Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. -- He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.
 
If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
