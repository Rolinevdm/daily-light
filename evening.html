<p><i><u>Evening</u></i></p>
<p><strong>I have glorified thee on the earth.</strong><br> <br>My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. -- I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.<br> <br>Wist ye not that I must be about my Fatherâ€™s business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. -- This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<br> <br>Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. -- Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well -- All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his mouth.<br> <br>Thou art worthy ... for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and peopIe, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.  </p>
