<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</strong>
 
The heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? -- Yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. How much less man, that is a worm?
 
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness? -- Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.
 
As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. -- Partakers of his holiness.
 
The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. -- What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, ... without spot, and blameless?
 
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
