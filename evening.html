<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Ye are the salt of the earth</strong>.
 
That which is not corruptible. -- Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. -- He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. -- The children of God, being the children of the resurrection. -- The uncorruptible God.
 
If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. -- It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.
 
Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. -- Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
