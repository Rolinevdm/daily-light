<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</strong>
 
There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. -- God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
 
The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him. -- He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
 
Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.
 
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.
