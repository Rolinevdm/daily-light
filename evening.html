<strong>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</strong>
 
Understanding what the will of the Lord is.
 
It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
 
This is the will of God, even your sanctification. -- That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. -- Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth: wherefore lay apart all filthiness.
 
Be ye holy; for I am holy. -- [Jesus] said, Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. -- Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
