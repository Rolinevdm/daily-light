<strong>Thou renderest to every man according to his work.</strong>
 
Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. -- We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
 
When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. -- After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God. -- LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
