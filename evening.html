<strong>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</strong>
 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
 
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. -- Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
 
Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, ... even as the garden of the LORD. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. -- [The Lord] delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations. -- Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
