<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</strong>
 
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. -- My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. -- He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee.
 
I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
 
Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, ... who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way: so also Christ, ... though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. -- Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.
