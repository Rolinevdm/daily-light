<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>En hakkore. (Or, The well of him that cried.)</strong>
 
If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. -- If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.
 
Prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. -- If ye, ... being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? -- Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find.
 
Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
