<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</strong>
 
Thou shalt have treasure in heaven: ... come and follow me. -- I am ... thy exceeding great reward. Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. -- They shall reign for ever and ever.
 
Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. -- The crown of life. -- A crown of righteousness. -- An incorruptible crown.
 
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou has given me. -- So shall we ever be with the Lord. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
