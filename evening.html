<strong>Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</strong>
 
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation. -- He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, ... they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
 
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am. -- Then he shall send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth, to the uttermost part of heaven. -- If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee.
 
The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet be Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
