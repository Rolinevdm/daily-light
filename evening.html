<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</strong>
 
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them. -- He whom thou lovest is sick. -- My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
 
Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. -- I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
 
We faint not; ... though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
 
In him we live, and move, and have our being. -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. -- The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.
