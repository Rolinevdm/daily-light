<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>They shall see his face.</strong>
 
I beseech thee shew me thy glory. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
 
Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. -- I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh.
 
I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. -- I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. -- The Lord himself shall descend from heaven ... the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
