<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</strong>
 
It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. -- Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
 
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
 
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord.
