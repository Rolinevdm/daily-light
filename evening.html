<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Where is the way that light dwelleth?</strong>
 
God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. -- As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
 
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- The Father ... hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
 
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. -- Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
