<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Thou compassest my path and my lying down.</strong>
 
Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
 
The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.
 
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only, makest me dwell in safety.
 
Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. -- When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. -- So he giveth his beloved sleep.
