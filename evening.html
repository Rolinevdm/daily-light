<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</strong>
 
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report. -- All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. -- The offence of the cross.
 
If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye: but let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
 
Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. -- If one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. -- If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.
