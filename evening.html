<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>O my God, my soul is cast down within me.</strong>
 
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.
 
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. -- He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. -- Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.
 
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? -- Be not faithless, but believing. -- Lo, I am with you alway.
