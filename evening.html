<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle.</strong>
 
When I am weak, then am I strong.
 
Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. -- Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him.
 
It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. -- There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
 
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God.
