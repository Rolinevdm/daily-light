<strong>God gave Solomon ... largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</strong>
 
Behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- The Prince of Peace.
 
Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- The love of Christ passeth knowledge.
 
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. -- In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. -- The unsearchable riches of Christ. -- Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
