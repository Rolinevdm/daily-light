<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>It is I; be not afraid.</strong>
 
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
 
Woe is me! for I am undone; ... mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
 
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
