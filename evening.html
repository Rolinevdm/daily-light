<strong>Hallowed be thy name.</strong>
 
Thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
 
Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? -- Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
 
Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. -- I saw ... the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone. -- I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself.
 
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. -- That we might be partakers of his holiness. -- Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart.
