<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</strong>
 
Ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious
 
O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory. -- My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.
 
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. -- They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. -- My people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord.
