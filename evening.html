I press toward the mark. -- I ... so run, not as uncertainly; I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, ... I myself should be a castaway.
 
The fashion of this world passeth away.
 
Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent. -- Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
