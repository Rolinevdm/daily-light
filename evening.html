<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.</strong>
 
He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
 
The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
 
Stand ... having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. -- The Lord is with thee, ... Go in this thy might.
