<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</strong>
 
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. -- He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. -- Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heaven.
 
Who is a rock save our God? -- They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. -- Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. -- Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.
