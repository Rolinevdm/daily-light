<i><u>Evening</u></i>
<strong>The Lord taketh my part.</strong>
 
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion. We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
 
When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. -- There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able: but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- The LORD is on my side; I will not fear.
 
Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us.
