<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>When thou has eaten and are full, ... thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</strong>
 
Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God. -- One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
 
Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. -- He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks. -- The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
 
Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, ... who forgiveth all thine iniquities; ... who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies.
