<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be strong and of a good courage.</strong>
 
The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life: of whom shall I be afraid? -- He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. -- My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
 
If God be for us, who can be against us? -- The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? -- Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
 
Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.
