<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting</strong>.
 
The LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him, actions are weighed. -- That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. -- The LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. -- Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.
 
What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? -- What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
 
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts. -- Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing.
