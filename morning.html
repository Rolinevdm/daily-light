<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The entrance of thy words giveth light.</strong>
 
This ... is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. -- God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. -- The Word was God. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. -- If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
 
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. -- Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
 
Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
