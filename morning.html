<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</strong>
 
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
 
Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temp-tations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. -- The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.
 
Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
