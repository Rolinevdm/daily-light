<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Take heed unto thyself.</strong>
 
Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. -- Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
 
They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. -- For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. -- Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
