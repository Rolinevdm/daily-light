<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</strong>
 
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. -- Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? -- Heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
 
The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me. -- God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
 
He that overeometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. -- There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. -- He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.
