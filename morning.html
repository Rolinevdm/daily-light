<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Praying in the Holy Ghost.</strong>
 
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. -- We ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
 
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
 
The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. -- When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.
 
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication.
