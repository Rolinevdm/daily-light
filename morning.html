<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Being made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</strong>
 
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. -- When ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
 
Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
 
If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. -- Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
 
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. -- I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
