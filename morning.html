<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The fruit of the Spirit is love.</strong>
 
God is love: and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. -- The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. -- Unto you ... which believe he is precious. -- We love him, because he first loved us. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
 
Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. -- This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. -- Above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. -- Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
