<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard.</strong>
 
Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. -- The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. -- Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. -- God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore to God.
 
Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
