<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will. And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</strong>
 
God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. -- Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. -- We are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. -- A ransom for many.
 
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. -- I will love them freely. -- The Son of God ... loved me and gave himself for me.
 
He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. -- He hath made us accepted in the beloved.
