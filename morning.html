<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The fruit of the Spirit is ... faith.</strong>
 
By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. -- Without faith it is impossible to please him. -- He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. -- Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
 
Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. -- Faith worketh by love. -- Faith without works is dead.
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
