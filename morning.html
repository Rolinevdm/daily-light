<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</strong>
 
I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. -- In his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. -- As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the LORD alone did lead him.
 
Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you. -- This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
 
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee. -- Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
 
Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
