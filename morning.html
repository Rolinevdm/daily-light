<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The fruit of the spirit is meekness.</strong>
 
The meek ... shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. -- Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. -- The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ... is in the sight of God of great price. -- Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.
 
Follow after meekness. -- Take my yoke upon you and learn O me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. -- He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth. -- Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled reviled not again, ... but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.
