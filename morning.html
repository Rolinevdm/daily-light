<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>In everything ye are enriched by him.</strong>
 
When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall be not with him also freely give us all things?
 
In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.
 
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine ye are the branches: he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. -- To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. -- Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
 
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.
