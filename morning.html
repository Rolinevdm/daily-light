<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, and in this place will I give peace.</strong>
 
The house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. -- The glory of the Lord ... filled the Lord's house.
 
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spake of the temple of his body. -- That which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth. -- The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. -- God ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.
 
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. -- The Prince of Peace. -- He is our peace. -- The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
