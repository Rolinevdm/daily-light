<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The disciple is not above his master.</strong>
 
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. -- If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. -- I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
 
Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
 
Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. -- Forasmuch ... as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind.
