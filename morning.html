<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</strong>
 
Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
 
I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. -- I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart. -- O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. -- If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. -- To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
 
Be not conformed to this world: but ye be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
