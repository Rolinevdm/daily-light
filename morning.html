<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</strong>
 
The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. -- He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.
 
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. -- In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. -- That in the ages to come he might shew the ex-ceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
