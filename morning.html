<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>We look for the Saviour.</strong>
 
The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world, looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. -- We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
 
Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. -- And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
