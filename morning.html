<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</strong>
 
Get wisdom, get understanding. -- The wisdom that is from above. -- The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. -- We are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.
 
Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. -- God ... hath quickened us together with Christ, ... and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
 
They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. -- Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness.
