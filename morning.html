<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption.</strong>
 
God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
 
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have com-passion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. -- O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. -- When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple. -- I waited patiently for the Lord. He brought me up ... out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock.
