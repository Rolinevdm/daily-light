<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</strong>
 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. -- The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. -- When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that wait for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. -- I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
 
The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. -- Blessed is the man that trustesth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.
 
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
