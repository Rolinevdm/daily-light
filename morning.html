<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</strong>
 
Here have we no continuing city. -- Ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
 
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
 
Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations. -- There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
 
We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened. -- God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
 
The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. -- Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
