<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</strong>
 
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. -- I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. -- The gospel of Christ ... is the power of God unto salvation.
 
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. -- I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. -- We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
 
The joy of the Lord is your strength. -- Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.
