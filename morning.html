<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>No man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</strong>
 
I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom. -- We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Your life is hid with Christ in God.
 
Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
 
Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
