<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</strong>
 
We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. -- Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death. that is, the devil. -- And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them. -- I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
 
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
