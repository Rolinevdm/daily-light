<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The king held out ... the golden sceptre. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre</strong>.
 
It shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
 
We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us.
 
Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- For through him we ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father. -- We have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. -- Let us there-fore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
