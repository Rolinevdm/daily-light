<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</strong>
 
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. -- David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. -- God will surelv visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. -- I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt. and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. -- There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel: all came to pass.
 
He is faithful that promised. -- Hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? -- Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away -- The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
