<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.</strong>
 
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. -- Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. -- He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. -- Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. -- I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
 
He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. -- He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
