<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Let not your good be evil spoken of.</strong>
 
Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. -- For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.
 
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
 
Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. -- Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. -- Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. -- Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
