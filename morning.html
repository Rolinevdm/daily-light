<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants.</strong>
 
Where is boasting then? It Is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. -- What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? -- By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
 
By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. -- For of him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things. -- All things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee.
 
Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
