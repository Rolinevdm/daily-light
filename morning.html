<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful.</strong>
 
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. -- The longsuffering of our Lord is salvation.
 
For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. -- Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
 
Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? -- Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
