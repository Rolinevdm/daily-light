<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</strong>
 
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. -- Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
 
We walk by faith, not by sight. -- We faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. -- An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.
