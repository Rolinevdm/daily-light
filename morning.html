<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent.</strong>
 
The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.
 
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
 
God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.
 
The faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations. -- All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. -- Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God ... which keepeth truth for ever.
