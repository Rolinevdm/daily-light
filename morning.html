<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.</strong>
 
Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.
 
Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
 
What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what com-munion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? -- Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. The world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
 
In time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. -- Ye have not so learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, ... as the truth is in Jesus.
