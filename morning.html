<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I am black, but comely.</strong>
 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. -- Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God. I am a sinful man, O Lord. -- Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair. I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. -- Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
 
When I would do good, evil is present with me. -- Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing -- Ye are complete in him. -- Perfect in Christ Jesus.
 
Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
