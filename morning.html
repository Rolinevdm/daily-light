<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</strong>
 
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. -- It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. -- I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. -- We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. -- How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. -- O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
