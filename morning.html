<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Brethren, the time is short.</strong>
 
Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. -- The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. -- As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. Death is swallowed up in victory. -- Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s. -- To live is Christ, and to die is gain.
 
Cast not away ... your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. -- The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
