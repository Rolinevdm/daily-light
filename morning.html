<strong>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us.</strong>
 
The love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. -- Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. -- Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. -- For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. -- Christ ... suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
 
Ye also ought to wash one anotherâ€™s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. -- We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
