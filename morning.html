<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause.</strong>
 
Is anything too hard for the LORD? -- Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. -- Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God. -- Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.
 
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD.
 
It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. -- The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
 
I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
