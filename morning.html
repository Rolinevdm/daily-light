<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</strong>
 
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. -- My brethren, ye ... are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. -- Being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ. -- The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. -- Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. -- If the Son ... shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
