<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.</strong>
 
Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great. -- I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: ... I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. -- He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
 
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. -- Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.
 
Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
