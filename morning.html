<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark, and there I will meet with thee.</strong>
 
The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest. -- Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
 
Having ... brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; ... let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. -- Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
 
Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation [mercy seat] through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. -- Through him we have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
