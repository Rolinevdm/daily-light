<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thy sins be forgiven thee.</strong>
 
I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. -- Who can forgive sins but God only?
 
I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. -- Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity. -- Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?
 
God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
 
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. -- Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
