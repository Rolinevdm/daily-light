<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>They that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</strong>
 
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. -- I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
 
I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. -- For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints, they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. -- The Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people. -- Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.
 
Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
