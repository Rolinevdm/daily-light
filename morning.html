<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</strong>
 
Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren: saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee. -- In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. -- Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. -- My meat is to do the will of him that sent me. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. -- Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.
