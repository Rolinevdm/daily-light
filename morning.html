<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</strong>
 
It pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. -- Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? -- We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that be died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
 
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. -- Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God.
