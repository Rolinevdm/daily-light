<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thy name shall be called Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</strong>
 
By his strength he had power with God: yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him. -- Abraham stag-gered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.
 
Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. -- If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. -- Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
 
Lord, increase our faith.
