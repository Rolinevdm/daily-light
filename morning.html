<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</strong>
 
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
 
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. -- The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. -- Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. -- My blood is drink indeed.
 
Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
