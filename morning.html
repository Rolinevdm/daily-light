<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The joy of the Lord is your strength.</strong>
 
Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth with singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted. -- Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. -- The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. -- My soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
 
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ those things which pertain to God. -- We ... joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. -- I will joy in the God of my salvation.
