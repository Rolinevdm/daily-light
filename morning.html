<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those which are revealed belong unto us.</strong>
 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
 
The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he will shew them his covenant. -- There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets. -- Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?
 
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. -- If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth.
