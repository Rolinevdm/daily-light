<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.</strong>
 
Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. -- Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. -- In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
 
He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. -- Our sufficiency is of God.
 
Lead us not into temptation. -- O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. -- My times are in thy hand.
