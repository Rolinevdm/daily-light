<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>His mercy is on them that fear Him.</strong>
 
Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
 
If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. -- The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
 
Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, ... and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord. -- To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. -- The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
