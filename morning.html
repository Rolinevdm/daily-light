<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</strong>
 
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. -- If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbradeth not; and it shall be given him. -- The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. -- God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. That no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. -- Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.
 
All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. -- Never man spake like this man. -- Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
