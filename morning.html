<strong>When he shall appear, we shall be like him; we shall see him as he is.</strong>
 
As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. -- Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
 
Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, that he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
 
Now we see through a glass. darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. -- Christ ... shall change our vile body ... that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. -- As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
