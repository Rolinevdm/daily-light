<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Godly sorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.</strong>
 
Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. -- If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
 
Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth me. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
 
Turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.
 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. -- He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. -- He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
