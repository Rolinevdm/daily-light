<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.</strong>
 
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. -- Abhor that which is evil. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.
 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
 
Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. -- Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
 
Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. -- Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. -- In him is no sin.
