<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>It is good for me to draw near to God.</strong>
 
LORD,  I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine  honour dwelleth. -- A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had  rather be a door keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the  tents of wickedness. -- Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and  causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall  be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
 
The  LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.  -- Therefore will the LORD wait that he may be gracious unto you, and  therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: for the  LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
 
Having  therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of  Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us: ...  let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having  our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.
