<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase.</strong>
 
He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. -- Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.
 
God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister.
 
I beseech you ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. -- The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves. but unto him which died for them, and rose again. -- Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
