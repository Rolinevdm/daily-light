<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.</strong>
 
The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 
Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. -- If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. -- Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. -- Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
