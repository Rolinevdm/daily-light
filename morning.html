<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.</strong>
 
I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil. -- There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
 
In Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace.
 
It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell: and having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself. -- Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past: ... that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
 
Trust ye in the LORD for ever, for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.
