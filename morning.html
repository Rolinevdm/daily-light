<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.</strong>
 
Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. -- My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
 
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. -- Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord, Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
 
Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house that I have builded? -- Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. -- Ye are the temple of living God.
