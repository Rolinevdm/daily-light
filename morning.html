<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>His commandments are not grievous.</strong>
 
This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life. -- Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
 
My yoke is easy, and my burden is light. -- If ye love me, keep my commandments. -- He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth under-standing. -- Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. -- Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them. -- I delight in the law of God after the inward man.
 
This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another. -- Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
