<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil! And God granted him that which he requested.</strong>
 
The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. -- When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
 
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. -- How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men. -- I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
 
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. -- The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
