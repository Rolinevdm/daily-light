<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</strong>
 
Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?
 
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.
 
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. -- Born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
 
My Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. -- The battle is not yours, but God's.
 
The LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's.
