<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</strong>
 
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for- ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have com-passion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
 
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with ever-lasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. -- I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
 
Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
