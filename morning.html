<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.</strong>
 
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. Love is strong as death. -- Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
 
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. -- In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.
 
Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. -- I beseech you ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
