<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</strong>
 
The world passeth away, and the lust thereof. -- Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches. and knoweth not who shall gather them. -- What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
 
Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. -- I would have you without carefulness.
 
These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world. -- The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. -- The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
