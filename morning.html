<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.</strong>
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. -- Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. -- In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. -- Your life is hid with Christ in God.
 
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting the Lord.
 
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
