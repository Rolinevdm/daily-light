<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>In thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</strong>
 
In the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory. -- Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
 
The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe. To declare ... at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. -- Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
