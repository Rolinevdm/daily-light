<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</strong>
 
In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. -- She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
 
The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- If by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. -- Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ, ... hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
 
God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. -- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
