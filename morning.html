<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect</strong>.
 
I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. -- Ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should he mine.
 
Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's
 
Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power. -- Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity. -- Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
 
Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. -- Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. -- Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
