<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong>
 
Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that be might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. -- Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
 
The peace of God ... passeth all understanding. -- Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body.
 
Our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. -- Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
