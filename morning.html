<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof.</strong>
 
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the taber-nacle. -- Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. -- At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise. But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
 
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, ... having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.
 
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowâ€‘citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.
 
If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
