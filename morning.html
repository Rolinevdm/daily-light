<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.</strong>
 
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. -- For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
 
My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. -- One pearl of great price. -- The prince of the kings of the earth.
 
His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. -- The head over all things. -- He is the head of the body, the church.
 
His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers. -- He could not be hid.
 
His lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. -- Never man spake like this man.
 
His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. -- Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. -- LORD, lift thou up the light thy countenance upon us.
