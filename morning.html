<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</strong>
 
Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and I have nothing to set before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
 
I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. -- As a prince hast thou power with God and with men. -- Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.
 
[Jesus] went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
