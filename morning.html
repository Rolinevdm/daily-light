<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I know their sorrows.</strong>
 
A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. -- Touched with the feeling of our infirmities.
 
Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. -- Jesus being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well.
 
When Jesus ... saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. Jesus wept. -- For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
 
He hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death. -- He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. -- When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.
 
He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. -- In all their affliction he was afflicted; and the angel of his presence saved them.
