<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be not far from me; for trouble is near.</strong>
 
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? -- Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
 
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. -- The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
 
I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. -- Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. -- Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. -- My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
