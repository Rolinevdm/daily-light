<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Sit still, my daughter.</strong>
 
Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted. -- Be still, and know that I am God. -- Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? -- The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
 
Mary ... sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. -- Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. -- In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. -- Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.
 
Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
 
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. His heart is established.
 
He that believeth shall not make haste.
