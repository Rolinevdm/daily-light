<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.</strong>
 
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. -- Lord, when saw we thee a hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? -- In lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. -- Be clothed with humility.
 
[Jesus] was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. -- All that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on Stephen, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. -- The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them. -- We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
 
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
