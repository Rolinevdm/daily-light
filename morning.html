<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</strong>
 
Ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. -- As ye have ... received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. -- He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- That on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
 
By faith ye stand.
 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
 
He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
