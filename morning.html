<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.</strong>
 
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. -- While I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
 
Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. -- Be not thou far from me, O Lord, O my strength, haste thee to help me.
 
Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee. -- Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us. -- Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.
