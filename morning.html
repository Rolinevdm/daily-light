<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</strong>
 
Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. -- Ye are the salt of the earth, ... the light of the world. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is heaven.
 
I also withheld thee from sinning against me.
 
The Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. -- So did not I, because of the fear of God. -- Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father. -- Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
