<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</strong>
 
So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
 
Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. -- Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
 
Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world. At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me. -- When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.
 
Look, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. -- I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore. -- I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. -- My peace I give unto you.
