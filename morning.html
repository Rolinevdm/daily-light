<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Then cometh the end.</strong>
 
Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. -- The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to usâ€‘ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. -- The coming of the Lord draweth nigh. The judge standeth before the door. -- Surely I come quickly.
 
Seeing ... that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.
 
The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. -- Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
