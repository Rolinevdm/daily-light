<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Christ, who is the image of God.</strong>
 
The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. -- He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- God was manifest in the flesh.
 
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstâ€‘born of every creature. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
 
As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
