<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Pray one for another, that ye may be healed.</strong>
 
Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
 
Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. -- Pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.
 
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word. -- Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
 
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
