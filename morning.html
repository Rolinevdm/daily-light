<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</strong>
 
No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
 
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies sake. Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee. -- Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. -- Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.
 
The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
 
Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
