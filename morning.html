<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</strong>
 
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power. -- As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. -- Trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. -- Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.
 
I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
 
Fight the good fight of faith. -- In nothing terrified by your adversaries.
