<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.</strong>
 
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
 
We love him, because he first loved us.
 
Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
