<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>A servant of Jesus Christ.</strong>
 
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. -- If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. -- Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
 
What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. -- Being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
 
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. -- Thou art no more a servant, but a son.
 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.
