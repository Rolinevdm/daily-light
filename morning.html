<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.</strong>
 
[Abrahaml staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. -- The children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea. -- It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. -- The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
 
O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
