<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</strong>
 
I know that thou canst do every thing. -- The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. -- He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? -- There is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? -- Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee.
 
Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. -- Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. -- The mighty God. -- All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. -- Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed, ... there be more with us than with him.
