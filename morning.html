<strong>Let us go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</strong>
 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- As ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
 
They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. -- Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
