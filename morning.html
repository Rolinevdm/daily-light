<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</strong>
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 
Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? ... If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
 
Unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
