<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</strong>
 
Let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil. -- If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. -- Be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world. -- Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
 
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart; so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. -- Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
