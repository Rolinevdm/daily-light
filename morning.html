<strong>He led them on safely.</strong>
 
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment.
 
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. -- In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
 
They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. -- So didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
 
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. -- O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
