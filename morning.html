<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>By love serve one another.</strong>
 
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
 
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. -- Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. -- Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. -- Be kindly affectioned one to another in brotherly love; in honour preferring one another. -- Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
 
We ... that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
