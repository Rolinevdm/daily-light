<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</strong>
 
The LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. -- As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
 
After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. -- There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
 
The LORD our Righteousness.
