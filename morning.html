<strong>He is altogether lovely.</strong>
 
My meditation of him shall be sweet. -- My beloved is ... the chiefest among ten thousand. -- A chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. -- Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips. -- God ... hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. -- It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.
 
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
 
I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
