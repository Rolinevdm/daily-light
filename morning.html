<p><strong>The fruit of the Spirit is peace.</strong><br> <br>To be spiritually minded is life and peace.<br> <br>God hath called us to peace. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.<br> <br>I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.<br> <br>The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. -- Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.<br> <br>Great peace have they which love thy law.  </p>
