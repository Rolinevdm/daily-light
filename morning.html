<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</strong>
 
The love of the Spirit. -- The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. -- In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.
 
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. -- After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of the inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession. -- This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
 
The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.
