<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</strong>
 
Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. -- We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope.
 
It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. -- Ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. -- Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts.
