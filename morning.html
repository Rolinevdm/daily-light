<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.</strong>
 
Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests. -- Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
 
Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the Ministers of our God. -- Priests of God and of Christ.
 
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus. -- By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. -- The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
