<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</strong>
 
O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. -- How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!
 
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. -- Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
 
How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! -- The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
