<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down.</strong>
 
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. -- We ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
 
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. -- Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. -- It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
 
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. -- That blessed hope ... the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. -- Our conversation is in heaven.
