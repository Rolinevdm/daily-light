<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>He ever liveth to make intercession.</strong>
 
Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that died ... who also maketh inter-cession for us. -- Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.
 
If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. -- There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
 
Seeing ... that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. -- Through him we ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
