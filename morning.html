<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Serving the Lord with all humility of mind.</strong>
 
Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
 
If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. -- I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man, ... not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. -- When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
 
Our rejoicing is this, ... that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world. -- We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
