<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</strong>
 
Holiness, without which no man can see the Lord. -- God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. -- But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. -- I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.
 
This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. -- Holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
 
For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. -- Seeing ... that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us ... come boldly unto the throne of grace. that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
