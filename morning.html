<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shalI be clean.</strong>
 
The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul. -- He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. -- Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
 
I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin. -- I will melt them. and try them.
 
Thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. We went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
 
When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
