<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</strong>
 
My days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. -- Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep ... in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up: in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. -- Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.
 
The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. -- They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.
