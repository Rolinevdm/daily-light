<strong>The free gift is of many offences unto justification.</strong>
 
Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. -- I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. -- Not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. -- And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
