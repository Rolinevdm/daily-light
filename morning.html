<strong>If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and jointâ€‘heirs with Christ.</strong>
 
If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
 
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. -- Thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. -- Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.
 
Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me.
 
He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him I will give power over the nations. -- To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
