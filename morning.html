<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>They shall put my name upon the childen of Isael; and I will bless them.</strong>
 
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. -- We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
 
All people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. -- The LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
 
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. -- Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? -- The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
