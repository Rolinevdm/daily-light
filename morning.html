<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.</strong>
 
Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. -- Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
 
Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. -- For I came down from heaven, not to do mine will, but the will of him that sent me. -- The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
 
The Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. -- My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, -- Mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth.
