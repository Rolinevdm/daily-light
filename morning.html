<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation.</strong>
 
Ye know how we exhorted ... and charged every one of you, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. -- Ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
 
Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
 
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. -- Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
