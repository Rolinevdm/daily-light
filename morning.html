<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house.</strong>
 
One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
 
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. -- He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
 
He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. -- I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
 
How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
