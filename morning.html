<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Stand fast in the Lord.</strong>
 
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
 
The Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever. -- The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
 
The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back into perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. -- If they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
 
If ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed. -- He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. -- Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. -- He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.
