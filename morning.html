<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</strong>
 
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who ... took upon him the form of a servant. -- Even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. -- He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
 
When Jesus ... saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. -- Jesus wept. -- Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
 
Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
