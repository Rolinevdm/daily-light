<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The meek will he teach his way.</strong>
 
Blessed are the meek.
 
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill. -- A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God. -- Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
 
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
 
When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.
