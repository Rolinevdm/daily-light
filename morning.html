<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.</strong>
 
That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.
 
God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto he called you, ... to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. -- Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
 
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. -- God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
