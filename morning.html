<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</strong>
 
The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. -- Christ ... hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. -- The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing.
 
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
 
No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. -- Through him we ... have access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God. -- Having ... boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. -- We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
