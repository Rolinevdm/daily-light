<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</strong>
 
The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mol-lified with ointment. -- We are all as an unclean thing, and all our right-eousnesses are as filthy rags. -- I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.
 
Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- The King's daughter is all glorious within. -- Perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.
 
Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us.
 
These are they which ... have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. -- A glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but ... holy and without blemish. -- Ye are complete in him.
