<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</strong>
 
I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. -- There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. -- There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
 
The mighty God. -- Who made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. -- We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. -- Forasmuch ... as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same.
