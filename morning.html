<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>The Lord pondereth the hearts.</strong>
 
The LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish. -- The LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy. -- Thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. -- There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.
 
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. -- When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. -- He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
 
The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
