<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</strong>
 
Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. -- Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
 
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; ... we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
 
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
