<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>I am the Lord which sanctify you.</strong>
 
I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people. And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.
 
Sanctified by God the Father. -- Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. -- The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 
Jesus ... that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. -- Our Saviour Jesus Christ ... gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. -- Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren. -- For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. -- Through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
