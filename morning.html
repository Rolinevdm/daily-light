<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends.</strong>
 
The Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? -- It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. -- God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. -- Even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory.
 
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. -- The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he will shew them his covenant. -- I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
