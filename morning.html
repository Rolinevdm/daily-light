<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep.</strong>
 
The chief Shepherd. -- I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
 
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity us all. -- I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. -- I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. -- Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
