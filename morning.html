<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</strong>
 
It is the Spirit that quickeneth. -- The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance.
 
I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. -- The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. -- The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. -- If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. -- This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.
 
No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
