<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</strong>
 
I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
 
When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. -- The Spirit ... helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. -- Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
 
If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
