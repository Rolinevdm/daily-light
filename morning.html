<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me.</strong>
 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. -- Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
 
Ye are a royal priesthood ... that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. -- Ye ... as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. -- By him ... let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.
 
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.
