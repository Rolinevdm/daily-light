<i><u>Morning</u></i>
<strong>See that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</strong>
 
Take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. -- Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. -- Abstain from all appearance of evil.
 
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. -- Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
 
Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if we do these things, ye shall never fall. -- Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching.
