      "I and my Father are one, the Father is in me, and I in him. -- Had ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. -- Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father. -- Behold I and the children which God hath given me. -- He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied. -- I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. -- Before Abraham was, I am. -- God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.",
      "Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever. -- He is before all things, and by him all things consist. -- In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
