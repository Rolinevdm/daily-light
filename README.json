      "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. -- Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forebearance of God; to declare I say at this time his righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. -- He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. -- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? It is God that justifieth. -- To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteousness."
