      "Thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.",
      "When I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine. -- Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.",
      "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. -- Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen."

      "Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted. -- Be still, and know that I am God. -- Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? -- The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.",
      "Mary ... sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. -- Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. -- In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. -- Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.",
      "Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.",
      "He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. His heart is established.",
