      "Thou ... hast made us unto our God kings and priests. -- The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.",
      "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. -- Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven. -- The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. -- Pray one for another: the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.",

      "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. -- Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.",
      "Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. -- Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. -- For I came down from heaven, not to do mine will, but the will of him that sent me. -- The cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?",
