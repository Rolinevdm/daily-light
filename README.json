      "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. -- There was given to me a thorn in the flesh. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.",
      "I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. -- Hannah ... was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and ... wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life. The Lord remembered her.",

      "When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. -- Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again. -- Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth. -- Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. -- If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. -- Be ye kind one to another, tender‑hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.",
