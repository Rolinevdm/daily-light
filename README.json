      "He brought me up ... out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. -- The Son of God ... loved me, and gave himself for me. -- He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? -- God commendeth love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died us.",
      "Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. -- Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.",
      "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."

      "Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. -- For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel. -- I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. -- With the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.",
