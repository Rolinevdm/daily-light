      "The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.",
      "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. -- While the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.",
      "The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. -- God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.",
      "Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. -- Trust ... in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy."

      "In the world ye shall have tribulation. -- The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.",
      "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
