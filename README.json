      "Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee ... Mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. -- O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?",
      "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves ... which have the firstâ€‘fruits of the Spirit ... groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. -- Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations.",
      "Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle. -- For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
