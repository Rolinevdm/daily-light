      "The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.",
      "He ... kneeled down, and prayed. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.",
      "It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: ... they took Jesus, and led him away, ... into a place called ... Golgotha: where they crucified him.",
      "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast."

      "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. -- When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?",
      "Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy people. -- How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men. -- I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.",
      "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. -- The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate."
