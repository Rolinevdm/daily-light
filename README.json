      "This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies may be made his footstool. -- Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.",
      "He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.",
      "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. -- He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. -- He shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords."

      "Your life is hid with Christ in God. -- He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. -- Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. -- God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear.",
      "Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. -- Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. -- I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
