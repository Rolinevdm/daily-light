      "O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! and the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, for they have even taken of the accursed thing ... and they have put it even among their own stuff.",
      "Behold, the Lordâ€™s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.",
      "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.",
      "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."

      "Even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. -- Whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. Jesus of Nazareth ... went about doing good. -- Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. The meekness and gentleness of Christ. -- In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.",
