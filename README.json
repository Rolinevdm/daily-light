      "The  Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the  glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. --  Thou are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy  lips. -- All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which  proceeded out of his mouth.",
      "Ye have tasted that the Lord is  gracious. -- He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in  himself. -- We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen.",
      "O  taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth  in him. -- I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit  was sweet to my taste.",
      "He said unto me, My grace is sufficient  for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. -- Unto every one  of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. --  As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to  another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."

      "LORD,  I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine  honour dwelleth. -- A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had  rather be a door keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the  tents of wickedness. -- Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and  causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall  be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.",
      "The  LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. -- Therefore will the LORD wait that he may be gracious unto you, and  therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: for the  LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.",
      "Having  therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of  Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us: ...  let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having  our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience."
