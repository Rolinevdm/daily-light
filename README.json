      "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. -- Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.",

But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. -- I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. -- Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. -- God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. -- That he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.",
