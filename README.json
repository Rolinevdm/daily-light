      "Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.",
      "My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.",

      "My days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. -- Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep ... in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up: in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. -- Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.",
      "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. -- They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. -- Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever."
