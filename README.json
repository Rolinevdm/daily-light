      "When I am weak, then am I strong.",
      "Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. -- Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him.",
      "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. -- There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.",
      "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God."

      "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. -- No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. -- He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- God was manifest in the flesh.",
      "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstâ€‘born of every creature. -- Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.",
