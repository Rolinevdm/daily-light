      "I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. -- The heavens and the earth, which are now, ... are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment.",
      "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. -- Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled.",
      "We have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. -- We ... look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."

For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. -- He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.",
