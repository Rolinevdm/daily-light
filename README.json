      "Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. -- Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
      "Jesus, ... that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.",
      "[Jesus] said, ... Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. -- The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake."

      "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast. -- Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.",
      "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. -- Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. -- Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",
