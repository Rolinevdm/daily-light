      "Ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious",
      "O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory. -- My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. -- Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.",
      "I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. -- They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. -- My people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord."

      "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee. And all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. -- Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.",
      "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. -- In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted. -- The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand."
