      "The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. -- We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.",
      "My speech and my preaching was ... in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",

      "Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great. -- I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: ... I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. -- He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. -- I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
      "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. -- Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.",
      "Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall."
