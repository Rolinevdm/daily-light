      "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. -- Whosoever shall give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.",

The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. -- As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. -- It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. --Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have commited much, of him they will ask the more.",
