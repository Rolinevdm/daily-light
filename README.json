      "Thou shalt bruise his heel. -- This is your hour, and the power of darkness. -- As the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. -- Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.",
      "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith. -- Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.",
      "The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. -- The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. -- The devil ... was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone ... and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

      "Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. -- The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary. -- His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.",
      "All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. -- He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.",
      "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. -- The sword of the Spirit ... is the word of God. -- The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoâ€‘edged sword. -- The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."
