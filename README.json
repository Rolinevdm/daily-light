      "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. -- God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. -- God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."

      "Forasmuch ... as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
