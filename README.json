      "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. -- The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. -- If the Son ... shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.",
      "Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. -- Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
      "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. -- Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."

      "Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -- Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.",
