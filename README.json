      "Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven. The Lord scattered them. -- Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; it was well watered every where, even as the garden of the Lord. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.",
      "I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. -- I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I gathered me also silver and gold. Then I looked on all, and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit.",
      "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. -- He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.",

From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. -- We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. -- I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.",
      "Ye are washed, ... ye are sanctified, ... ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. -- The King's daughter is all glorious within. -- Perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.",
