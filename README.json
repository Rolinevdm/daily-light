      "Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. -- Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",
      "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. -- Aaron held his peace. -- It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good. Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. -- Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.",
      "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

      "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. -- Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.",
      "We walk by faith, not by sight. -- We faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. -- An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you."
