      "As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. -- The Spirit of truth ... will shew you things to come.",
      "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.",
      "I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."

      "Jesus ... made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, ... that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. -- One died for all. -- As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.",
      "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spint. -- That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. -- God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. -- God ... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- Thou hast given him power over all flesh.",
      "The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
