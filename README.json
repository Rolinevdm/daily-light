      "Toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat.",
      "Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.",
      "If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. -- All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins."

      "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you. -- They brought young children to him, that he should touch them. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. -- Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat; and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. -- A high Priest ... touched with the feeling of our infirmities. -- In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.",
