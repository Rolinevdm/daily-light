      "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. -- By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. -- Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.",
      "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.",

      "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry here, and watch with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. -- And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.",
      "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. -- Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. -- I looked on my right hand, and behold, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.",
