      "This is not your rest: ... it is polluted, it shall destroy you. -- Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. -- If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. -- Set your heart and your soul to seek your God: arise therefore.",
      "Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. -- Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.",
      "While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. -- Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. -- Now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. -- Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he finds you sleeping."

      "By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. -- When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light. -- Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.",
      "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. -- We have also a sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place. -- Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. -- They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever."
