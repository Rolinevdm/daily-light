      "A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us. -- Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. -- By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.",
      "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. -- Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. -- Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. -- I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, ... cried ... saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb."

      "Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; ... then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God: ... for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.",
      "Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. -- They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them -- There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us."
