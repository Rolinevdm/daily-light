      "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.",
      "I saw no temple: ... for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.",
      "I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. -- Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.",
      "Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in Zion. -- Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. -- There shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him."

      "God hath called us to peace. -- Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. -- The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.",
      "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. -- Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.",
      "The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places. -- Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.",
