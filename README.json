      "We having the same spirit of faith.",
      "As chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.",
      "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.",

      "Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. -- If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. -- The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.",
      "Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth me. Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.",
      "Turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.",
      "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. -- He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. -- He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
