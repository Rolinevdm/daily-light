      "It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. -- Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation.",

      "Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins. -- That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness. -- He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.",
      "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. -- Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, ... that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations. -- He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.",
      "Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, ... to give repentance. -- Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. -- Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
