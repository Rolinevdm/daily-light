      "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. -- Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?",
      "I am the LORD, and there is none else; there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.",

      "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. -- He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.",
      "What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. -- In the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.",
