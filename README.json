      "Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me. -- It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.",
      "I beseech you, ... brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. -- Jesus ... that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. -- Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",

      "O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether ... Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it is high, I cannot attain unto it.",
      "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. -- The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings. -- God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. -- The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.",
      "Jesus ... knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man; for he knew what was in man. -- Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee."
