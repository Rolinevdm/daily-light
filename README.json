      "Without faith it is impossible to please him. -- So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. -- The Lord taketh pleasure in his people.",
      "This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. -- The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, ... is in the sight of God of great price.",
      "Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. -- I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.",

      "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. -- The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. -- The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.",
      "Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies sake. Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee. -- Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. -- Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.",
