      "His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor. -- Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding, I have strength. -- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. -- Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.",
      "O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. -- Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. -- Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established. -- He knoweth the way that I take. -- Man's goings are of the Lord: how can a man then understand his own way?",
      "Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. -- This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death."
