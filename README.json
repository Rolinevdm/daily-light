      "This poor widow hath cast in more than they all. -- Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. -- If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.",
      "Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. -- If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? -- He which soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",

      "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity. -- Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you ... depart from me, ye that work iniquity. -- The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.",
      "Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me. -- Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm. -- The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.",
